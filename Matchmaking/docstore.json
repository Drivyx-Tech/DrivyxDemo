We arrived at our farm (sight unseen) located between Bundaberg and Seventeen-Seventy on Gooreng Gooreng country. Our farm was not looking healthy, having been neglected and subject to drought for the past several years. But we could see our land's potential. As custodians of our land, we set out to establish regenerative, sustainable and ethical farming techniques.\nWith limited hands-on experience but big intentions and dreams, we experimented with mixed farming ventures, and it didn't take long for us to realise we had bitten off more than we could chew. We quickly reassessed, listened to our community, and realised that farming meat chickens was where our hearts were aligned. Regeneratively farming meat chickens improves our soil health and rejuvenates our pastures whilst supplying our family and community with ethically raised and nutrient-dense poultry.Continue learning how to increase the nutrient density of our chickens.\nContinue implementing best-practice farming methods to improve soil health.\nShare our produce and knowledge with our community.\nEstablish an onsite poultry processing facility and distribution business.\nAfter raising meat chickens, processing them on farm and running workshops, we quickly realised that our community wanted to support our vision to grow and process chickens ethically on pasture, offering our region paddock to plate poultry. Unfortunately, the closest abattoir is three and a half hours from our farm, which does not align with our intention to produce and process ethical poultry.

We run Merino ewes for wool and White Suffolk rams for lambs. Four years ago, we began to question how we were farming and subsequently stopped using most inputs and chemicals and started our journey to improve soil health.\nWe are improving soil health through grazing management, adding more paddocks, running animals in 1-2 mobs (except during lambing), and the use of cover crops in summer and winter. We have also undertaken tree/native understorey planting to increase biodiversity on our farm, which includes fencing off paddock trees to protect them.We received a Landcare grant to fence off a seasonal creek several years ago. The creek now has thick native vegetation throughout.\nWe also received funding for a grey box grassy woodland corridor two years ago. We maintain both these sites as best we can.\nWe would like to fence off our dams to restore habitat but haven't tackled this yet as it is an expensive project.['Regenerative Practices']{'Email': 'mailto:benacre49@gmail.com'}", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1046, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2431b0dc-0b13-4117-bd4d-8f25bbaab49a": {"__data__": {"id_": "2431b0dc-0b13-4117-bd4d-8f25bbaab49a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "FOLK Small Farm", "url": "https://blackduckfoods.org/", "contact": "{'Instagram': 'https://www.instagram.com/folksmallfarm/', 'Email': 'mailto:kathrynmaya@gmail.com'}", "location": "location:  city='Brisbane' country='Australia' continent='Oceania'", "document_title": "\"Growing Health and Sustainability: A Farming Journey Towards a Brighter Future\"", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

Stormflower is owned and operated by David Martin, one of the founders of Little Creatures Brewery in Fremantle, the Alex Hotel in Perth and Weelhamby Farm in Perenjori. David bought the vineyard in June 2007 with two friends and bought out his partners in 2014. With David\u2019s daughter Alex and son in law Tim now living locally and both involved in Stormflower, it is becoming more deeply rooted as a small family business.\nThe aim of Stormflower is to create a wine business that is small, single vineyard and produces wine of the highest quality but does not take itself too seriously. Being located in Wilyabrup among some world class wineries it is important to produce great quality Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay, and that is a constant focus of our team. All wines are made only with fruit from our vineyard.\nSustainable farming is an integral part of the Stormflower philosophy. We pay great attention to the health of the soil, and this results in a vineyard that is a healthy, biodiverse and resilient system. The vineyard has gone through many changes since we bought it in 2007. We have been working hard to make the vineyard more resilient to extreme weather and disease by focusing on the health of the soil and consequently the vines. We began our organic journey more than 10 years ago and over this time the use of humates, fish emulsion, seaweed products and molasses has improved the native soil microbiology and contributed to soil health and the growing of better cover crops which protect the surface of the soil. To these simple organic practices, we have more recently focused on basic management of soil pH and nutrition, particularly organic phosphates, which has created a snowballing effect of good health in the vineyard.

We grow, pick, make, and package ourselves. Our fruit wines, spirits and liqueurs are unique handcrafted, single-origin, small-batch products created in our nano-distillery.\nWe take a soil-first approach to growing and are committed to healing the soil and rebalancing the ecosystem on our farm. We do not use any herbicides, fungicides or pesticides on or near our crops, nor do we use synthetic fertilisers. We foster diversity in our patches by growing a variety of crops together, and companion planting. We feed the soil locally sourced organic matter, and fertigate our crops with compost, kelp and fish waste teas. Every decision we make is guided by our commitment to soil health, natural growing, nutrient-dense food, utilising what we have, and planning for continuous improvement.Plump Berries\u2019 key project is producing high quality, nutrient dense berries, fruits, fruit spirits and wines, primarily for local consumption. Our key regenerative project is managing the recovery of the ecosystem following conventional farming practices. We arrived on the farm in April 2022. Our soil restoration strategy started with no chemical use, the addition of organic composts, mulches and fertigation sprays, and diversification of companion plants, to rebuild soil structure and biology. Soil testing in early 2023 reinforced the ongoing strategies and guided new ones. The diversity of insect and arachnid life increased noticeably in the first berry season, by enabling nature to heal the ecosystem. We are continuing with these strategies and also planning more to further increase diversity and improve soil health. In keeping with regenerative principles, we are also planning towards greater use of livestock on the farm and improving the health of the waterway.['Regenerative Practices']{'Instagram': 'https://www.instagram.com/plump_berries/', 'Facebook': 'https://www.facebook.com/plumpberriesfarm', 'Email':", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2022, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08630bf3-41ad-4939-be99-d99f70c0938f": {"__data__": {"id_": "08630bf3-41ad-4939-be99-d99f70c0938f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "Plump Berries", "url": "https://blackduckfoods.org/", "contact": "{'Instagram': 'https://www.instagram.com/plump_berries/', 'Facebook': 'https://www.facebook.com/plumpberriesfarm', 'Email': 'mailto:olivia@plumpberries.com.au', 'Website': 'https://www.plumpberries.com.au/'}", "location": "location:  city='Brisbane' country='Australia' continent='Oceania'", "document_title": "\"Plump Berries: A Guide to Regenerative Farming Practices for Sustainable Agriculture and Handcrafted Spirits\"", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

We immediately removed fungicide and insecticide and have slowly reduced our artificial fertiliser usage. We still use a minimal amount of herbicide that we buffer with citric acid and fulvic acid as a knockdown spray before we sow our crops, but we continue to look for alternative methods.\n2022 was our first year farming without artificial inputs. We now use vermicast, guano, compost and mineral sprays to improve soil health and feed our crops. We will create our own bio fertiliser in the upcoming season and continue to try different crops and varieties.\nWe are now five years into our regenerative journey and are improving our practices and soil health every day.We are currently building a Local Goodies Food hub in Denmark, WA.

We were certified organic from 2005 to 2021 and are now focussing on implementing regenerative agriculture practices and educating others. A Landcare Australia-funded program revealed we are carbon negative as the property absorbs six times the amount of CO2 (and equivalents) than the vineyard emits. This has not been validated or accredited, however.\nWe conduct Organic and Regenerative Small Farm Tours, host speakers and conduct regenerative agriculture workshops. Speakers have included Matthew Evans and Christine Jones. We won the Sustainability Award by our local Chamber of Commerce in 2019. We have been featured by the following organisations: Post Growth Australia, Circular Economy WA, Lower Blackwood LCDC, and South Coast Alliance (in progress).\nA number of organisations have asked us to tell our Net Zero story, including our Chamber of Commerce, at a forthcoming Investment Forum.We will continue implementing regenerative viticulture strategies, including planting warm and cool season cover crops, and will conduct sap analysis this year.\nWe are hosting a COBWA Soil and Plant Health Monitoring workshop in October and an Eco Orchard workshop in March 2024 (subject to funding approval).\nOur Organic and Regenerative Small Farm Tours are ongoing. We have put together an Eco Weddings package showcasing other local sustainable businesses and also hire vintage items (Albany Vintage Hire).\nWe have just installed an EV charger for customers.\nWe plan to start a YouTube channel in the near future to showcase regenerative agriculture in vineyards and orchards.\nLate this year, we will be opening our Closed Loop Orchard and investigate strategies to sell our fruit, olives, and apple cider vinegar directly to our local community.['Regenerative Practices']{'Instagram': 'https://www.instagram.com/oranjetractorfarm/', 'Facebook': 'https://www.facebook.com/oranjetractor', 'Email': 'mailto:info@oranjetractor.com', 'Website':", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2041, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6fe2e74-a082-4435-8cf4-712451a378aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6fe2e74-a082-4435-8cf4-712451a378aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "Oranje Tractor Wine", "url": "https://blackduckfoods.org/", "contact": "{'Instagram': 'https://www.instagram.com/oranjetractorfarm/', 'Facebook': 'https://www.facebook.com/oranjetractor', 'Email': 'mailto:info@oranjetractor.com', 'Website': 'https://www.oranjetractor.com/'}", "location": "location:  city='Brisbane' country='Australia' continent='Oceania'", "document_title": "\"Sustainable Practices in Agriculture: A Journey with Oranje Tractor Wine\"", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

By streamlining their current cumbersome POS software, they can free up staff to pursue new product development and provide better service. An integrated e-commerce site will make the regenerative and organic product range at the Kandanga Farm Store effectively available to producers across Australia, giving them much-needed support, information and products to continue their individual regenerative farming journeys.['Funded by Sustainable Table', 'Ecological Practices (certifications)', 'Regenerative Practices']{'Instagram': 'https://www.instagram.com/kandangafarmstore/', 'Facebook': 'https://www.facebook.com/p/Kandanga-Farm-Store-100064738564570/', 'Email': 'mailto:info@kandangafarmstore.com.au', 'Website': 'https://www.kandangafarmstore.com.au/'}", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1999, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2cf271d0-febb-4a41-8418-0a764650b36e": {"__data__": {"id_": "2cf271d0-febb-4a41-8418-0a764650b36e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "Learning from Nature", "url": "https://blackduckfoods.org/", "contact": "{'Email': 'mailto:info@learningfromnature.com.au', 'Website': 'https://www.learningfromnature.com.au/'}", "location": "location:  city='Brisbane' country='Australia' continent='Oceania'", "document_title": "\"Revitalizing Ecosystems for Sustainable Agriculture: A Holistic Approach to Ensuring Food Security and Environmental Conservation\"", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

It also improves the marine eco-system as it grows. With ideal growing conditions here in Victoria, we think kelp might soon play an important role in our local food system.\nWe were lucky enough to be awarded Mornington Peninsula Shire\u2019s Climate Action Grant last year and this has enabled us to establish a kelp nursery on the Mornington Peninsula. We\u2019re now able to seed juvenile kelp onto twine that we can then take to our aquaculture site off Flinders to grow to maturity.

Royce & Sue saw the need for organic meat, and began the butcher business in 1999.\nRuby & Oliver continue to strive for the best possible environmental & health outcomes in their business by sourcing regeneratively farmed meat to add to the organic offer for their customers. With five stores in Melbourne, and a strong online delivery service for greater Victoria, Oliver has said eating meat 3-4 times a week is healthy for you and healthy for the planet, honest words from a butcher.We currently have three suppliers of regeneratively farmed produce to go alongside our Organic & Free-Range products. We're seeking to build awareness of the regenerative products, and help educate our customers on the different farming practices.[]{'Instagram': 'https://www.instagram.com/hagensorganics/', 'Facebook': 'https://www.facebook.com/HagensOrganics/', 'Email': 'mailto:heybutcher@hagensorganics.com.au', 'Website': 'https://hagensorganics.com.au/'}", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1100, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96a7b8ae-d5cd-48f2-88a7-e636172552a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "96a7b8ae-d5cd-48f2-88a7-e636172552a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "Hagen\u2019s Organics Beaumarris", "url": "https://blackduckfoods.org/", "contact": "{'Instagram': 'https://www.instagram.com/hagensorganics/', 'Facebook': 'https://www.facebook.com/HagensOrganics/', 'Email': 'mailto:heybutcher@hagensorganics.com.au', 'Website': 'https://hagensorganics.com.au/'}", "location": "location:  city='Brisbane' country='Australia' continent='Oceania'", "document_title": "Hagens Organics: Quality Butcher Shop and Deli Overview", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

Mountain Gourmet was started in 2022 after horrific flooding washed away Rhiannon's market garden management career in the Hawkesbury. Now, located in a flood-free area of The Blue Mountains region, the farming lives on! Rhiannon aims to provide high-quality, regeneratively grown produce to the local community to secure a food network while actively contributing to healthy land management.\nAt Mountains Gourmet, we believe in a healthy, vibrant community through a sustainable food system. We employ regenerative agriculture practices, such as cover cropping and using beneficial microbial sprays to improve soil health, increase biodiversity, and reduce our ecological footprint.\nCommunity involvement is vital to us. We collaborate with local farmers, education centres, co-operatives and consumers, building strong relationships and fostering a thriving local food economy. Education and awareness are central to the mission. We host workshops on a number of micro-farm sites throughout the Blue Mountains and visit childcare centres to implement educational programs and inspire and educate. Our goal is to empower individuals to make informed choices about their food and appreciate the value of healthy, locally grown, regeneratively produced food.Mountains Gourmet is currently growing on leased land with the hopes to one-day secure land to grow on permanently, risk-free.\nMountains Gourmet is still looking to expand to another plot of land for growing annuals. With limited land suitable for farming left in the Blue Mountains there has been a surprising amount of community members eager to offer land to grow on.

Our Oakleigh hub is fitted with a commercial kitchen and runs off the donation of produce from local growers and time given by our volunteer team. Participants are motivated by a desire to fight food waste and join a community of like-minded individuals. Portions of preserves are given back to the farmer, donated to local food banks and sold to fund the program.\nOur ethical and environmental coffee is for those who want their coffee to create real social impact whilst also tasting delicious. The coffee cherry is sourced directly from farmers in Timor-Leste using 100% organic farming methods on small-holder farms. We purchase green beans directly from subsistence farming communities at above international fair-trade prices, and then roast locally.[]{'Instagram': 'https://www.instagram.com/cornerstorenetwork/', 'Facebook': 'https://www.facebook.com/cornerstorenetwork/', 'Email': 'mailto:info@cornerstorenetwork.org.au', 'Website': 'https://cornerstorenetwork.org.au/'}", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1973, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f01baa5-6fa5-44d7-a8a3-a71d39dec556": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f01baa5-6fa5-44d7-a8a3-a71d39dec556", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "Minimum Wines", "url": "https://blackduckfoods.org/", "contact": "{'Instagram': 'https://www.instagram.com/minimumwines/', 'Facebook': 'https://www.facebook.com/minimumwines', 'Email': 'mailto:hello@minimumwines.com', 'Website': 'https://www.minimumwines.com/'}", "location": "location:  city='Brisbane' country='Australia' continent='Oceania'", "document_title": "\"Minimum Wines: Cultivating Joy, Sustainability, and Social Impact\"", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

A short stroll will see you stumble across fields of flowers and row upon row of lush greens and vegetables, also used and sold on-site.['Regenerative Practices']{'Instagram': 'http://instagram.com/thefarmatbyronbay', 'Facebook': 'https://www.facebook.com/thefarmbyronbay', 'Email': 'mailto:info@thefarm.com.au', 'Website': 'https://thefarm.com.au/'}", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1108, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fbc92785-2449-4fb5-9f8c-7f9b61506998": {"__data__": {"id_": "fbc92785-2449-4fb5-9f8c-7f9b61506998", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "Kinsfolk Farm", "url": "https://blackduckfoods.org/", "contact": "{'Instagram': 'http://instagram.com/kinsfolk_farm', 'Facebook': 'http://facebook.com/kinsfolk_farm', 'Email': 'mailto:kinsfolkfarm@gmail.com', 'Website': 'http://kinsfolkfarm.com.au/'}", "location": "location:  city='Brisbane' country='Australia' continent='Oceania'", "document_title": "\"Kinsfolk Farm: Organic Market Gardeners, Creative Entrepreneurs, and Authors of Home Harvest - A Comprehensive Look at Sustainable Living and Business Practices\"", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

We employ organic principles to grow delicious and nutrient-dense vegetables to sell directly to our local community around the greater Geelong and surf coast region.\nWe are two young farmers with backgrounds in design and music, who packed up out of the big smoke and landed back in some familiar childhood territory. With little supply of fresh organic veg in the area, we set out to find a patch of land to grow our own and share it with others with a similar love for food and cooking. We now lease a pocket of fertile soil from the Menzies family in Moriac.\nWe grow over forty varieties of seasonal vegetables and herbs which you can find every Saturday at the Torquay Farmer's Market.Home Harvest is our first foray into writing and publishing. Alongside Hardie Grant books, we have created a fun, practical and easy-to-read deck of cards to help you plant and grow your own kitchen garden. Each card is beautifully illustrated by the phenomenal Edith Rewa, making this a stunning gift for every gardener or soon-to-be gardener in your life.['Regenerative Practices']{'Instagram': 'http://instagram.com/kinsfolk_farm', 'Facebook': 'http://facebook.com/kinsfolk_farm', 'Email': 'mailto:kinsfolkfarm@gmail.com', 'Website': 'http://kinsfolkfarm.com.au/'}", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1385, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3816f465-f311-425b-aeb7-5abc67707921": {"__data__": {"id_": "3816f465-f311-425b-aeb7-5abc67707921", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "Purpose Precinct (powered by Moving Feast)", "url": "https://blackduckfoods.org/", "contact": "{'Instagram': 'https://www.instagram.com/purposeprecinct/', 'Facebook': 'https://www.facebook.com/purposeprecinct/', 'Email': 'mailto:hello@movingfeast.net', 'Website': 'https://movingfeast.net/projects/queen-victoria-market-purpose-precinct'}", "location": "location:  city='Brisbane' country='Australia' continent='Oceania'", "document_title": "\"Empowering Social Enterprises and Food Innovation at QVM's Purpose Precinct: Creating a Regenerative Food System\"", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

The Precinct currently retails wares of 25+ social enterprises, with the aim to double that by 2024. The Precinct will also create employment pathways for priority jobseekers who face barriers to employment.\nQVM is Victoria\u2019s leading food destination, with 10+ million people visiting it each year. With such a strong connection to multiple points of the food system, including supply chains, retail and food waste, the Precinct is an ideal site for food system experimentation. The Precinct is soon to house shared infrastructure for Moving Feast, a network of social innovators collaborating to build a connected, fair and regenerative Victorian food system. The Precinct and Moving Feast share objectives for activating people and places for regenerative food futures.Circular innovation: Annually, over 960+ tonnes of QVM\u2019s organic food waste goes into composting. With the development of a shared preserving kitchen and retail pantry, food waste will be captured and turned into chutneys, sauces, jams, dried fruits and dried herbs and spices.\nGreen jobs: The new food infrastructure will create new employment pathways into waste capture, food preserving, retail and transport and logistics. Over 75 jobs will be created over the coming two years.\nFood tourism and experiences: Work is underway to develop some new food trails starting at QVM, encouraging people to explore the incredible things that regional food social enterprises have to offer.\nParticipation and collaboration: The site offers a real opportunity for people to come and roll up their sleeves, put on an apron, learn and share.

They roam free during the day and sleep in their caravans at night.\nWe currently service 40-plus stockists across the Mornington Peninsula, and we cannot keep up with demand, even though we have expanded the business fourfold since we began in 2018. We run a small Farm Gate, and our farm is part of a collective of farmers who farm following the regenerative model. Our chickens follow the cattle and fertilise the land as they go while scratching the cow dung and eating insect pests along the way.Lil\u2019s Yolky Dokey Eggs is currently refining the systems and processes required to run a successful business. We are hoping to mentor farmers who are interested in growing pasture-raised eggs on their property. By doing this, we believe that we will be contributing towards the growth in food security on the Mornington Peninsula and creating a quality product that will be available to the community.\nThe more farmers we have on the Mornington Peninsula, the better it will be for the community and ongoing food security.[]{'Instagram': 'https://www.instagram.com/yolkydokey/?hl=en', 'Facebook': 'https://www.facebook.com/Lils-Yolky-Dokey-Eggs-1802470646728191/', 'Email': 'mailto:yolkydokey@bigpond.com', 'Website': 'https://www.yolkydokey.com.au/'}", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1660, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aee29707-3ad7-4852-9d8a-fb653357fc25": {"__data__": {"id_": "aee29707-3ad7-4852-9d8a-fb653357fc25", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "Black Barn Farm", "url": "https://blackduckfoods.org/", "contact": "{'Instagram': 'https://www.instagram.com/black_barn_farm', 'Facebook': 'https://www.facebook.com/Black-Barn-Farm-170656333333476/', 'Email': 'mailto:jade@blackbarnfarm.com.au', 'Website': 'https://www.blackbarnfarm.com.au/'}", "location": "location:  city='Brisbane' country='Australia' continent='Oceania'", "document_title": "Black Barn Farm Contact Information and Team Members", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

We are working to realise a world where healthy, regenerated soils and landscapes support profitable food-producing businesses, thriving and resilient regional communities, and abundant and nutritious food.\n\nUnlike a decade ago, building soil health through regenerative farming approaches is no longer niche. Increasing numbers of farmers are looking to soil regeneration as a solution, having seen the benefits that healthy soils have brought to leading farmers around the country. However, there is a wide gap between interest and action. Changing practices involves risk and requires investment - of time, energy and money. Farmers need support to get to the point where they have confidence to take those risks and make those investments.\n\nWe believe that providing farmers with the knowledge, skills, confidence and supporting social infrastructure they need to lead a national effort to rebuild and restore soils will strengthen Australia\u2019s response to climate change while enabling the production of healthy, plentiful food and fibre in ways that are good for farmers, communities and the planet.Our case study program provides holistic examples of soil and landscape regeneration. This program is empowering farmers to build confidence to adopt regenerative approaches to agriculture. Case studies provide the foundation for our work, because farmers learn best from other farmers. Our case study farmers provide a powerful national network of change agents willing to share knowledge and champion the cause of regeneration. We coordinate a range of other projects supporting peer learning communities for soil and landscape regeneration, and farmer capacity building for soil and landscape literacy.

Explore our green globe at maps.gainforest.app.\n\nRather than relying on donations, we are developing a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) that employs community-operated conservation drones to employ local communities to gather vast amounts of machine learning-ready forest data. Local communities are rewarded for their efforts in digital Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (dMRV). In previous trial runs, we compensated individuals 50 cents for every tree measured, with a daily income cap of 10 USD per community member.\nOur objective is to scale these efforts, providing additionally low-cost conservation drones on loan and compensate local communities 5-10 USD for each drone mapping mission they undertake.\n\nCarbon credits often lack transparency and are susceptible to exploitation. Similarly, donations can be challenging to maintain consistently. At GainForest, we are convinced that data payments are the key to creating a reliable income source for local communities.\nData regarding biodiversity in the Global South is scarce.

The answer was obvious: plastics have no place in our rivers, so rivers should be 100% free of macro and microplastics.\nWhile that's certainly ambitious, the alternative of not even trying to make rivers plastic-free didn't and still doesn't feel right. The costs for present and future generations of plastic pollution are simply too devastating.\nAt one point, going to the moon was also considered impossible, yet people went. Ambition does not blind our sense of realism, though. Making rivers plastic-free is a step-by-step process. It may not be achievable for all rivers in the world, but every piece of plastic we collect is removed forever. So, every km of river cleaned is a step in the right direction.

On the physical side, DFSN will pursue decentralization projects like 50 Farms, which addresses multiple problems at once: creates a geographically distributed network of 50 farms doing CSA programs for healthy food supply and community engagement, improves long-term emergency preparedness, and provides both new farmer support and mentoring as well as monetary support of mid-size farms that are struggling. We're also putting on a Food Summit in Nov 2023 that will take a whole-systems approach, bringing together a wide variety of local and regional representatives not only in food production, processing and distribution, but also in food-related areas like housing, water and governance. This creates a distributed network of relationships critical to solving the problem of boosting food production.\nOn the virtual side, we'll be building capacity for additional revenue streams to food producers through securitizing natural assets on the model of -- and in collaboration with -- organizations like Centree and Kolektivo. While this model has often been applied just to forests, we seek to expand it to regenerative agriculture, wild-harvesting and marine-based food production (including kelp farming), all of which can sequester more carbon than steady-state forests. In the long run we want to use this to support a localized digital currency that will keep value circulating in the community, and free up food producers from the debt cycle that is driving many of them out of business.\ntwitter:ync2020", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 1995, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d318e004-6954-4b50-9c90-f709b03097c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "d318e004-6954-4b50-9c90-f709b03097c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "Jerri.wtf", "url": "https://jerri.wtf/", "contact": "twitter:jerri_nft", "location": "location:  city='' country='New Zealand' continent='Oceania'", "document_title": "\"Gamified NFT Projects and Mobile Games for Environmental Action: A Journey Towards a Sustainable Future\"", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

The project definitely has a long term impact in developing the environment of the village and would definitely build the lives of the downtrodden people of the village. The project would multiply in terms of more Green villages in the Neighborhood with the means and income generated with this project. This project would be a seed project for many future projects in the days to come and would become a ladder to create more Green Villages.\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1aa6W9YN_dnNZvUrbNDjIAOLUyti8NiXm/view?usp=sharing\ntwitter:welfareind", "start_char_idx": 4676, "end_char_idx": 6103, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8a47640-4700-47e9-bb64-c9be8ab78852": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8a47640-4700-47e9-bb64-c9be8ab78852", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "Web3beach", "url": "https://web3beach.io/", "contact": "twitter:web3beach", "location": "location:  city='' country='New Zealand' continent='Oceania'", "document_title": "\"Empowering Marginalized Communities through Web3: Leveraging Sustainable Impact for Social Change\"", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

Is it the lone commuter, the corporation with a large fleet, or municipalities that should take the lead? Recent data suggests that transportation is responsible for nearly 24% of direct CO2 emissions from fuel combustion. Yet, pinpointing accountability remains elusive, creating a diffusion of responsibility that slows progress.\nAccessibility in Carbon Credit Markets: While corporations and high-net-worth individuals trade in carbon credits, the average citizen finds this market out of reach. According to reports, the global carbon credit market was valued at approximately $215 billion in 2020, but its democratization remains a pipe dream.\nHere's where The Carbon Games comes in. We believe that enabling individuals to participate in carbon credit markets not only aligns incentives for sustainable behavior but also democratizes this important economic landscape. Imagine a scenario where a U.S.-based company incentivizes sustainable commuting in India, creating a global network of carbon accountability. We're not just reducing emissions; we're creating a participatory ecosystem that turns every individual into a stakeholder in our planet's future.\nWhat Have We Built and Where Are We Going?\nAs of now, our carpooling app is live on both the App Store and Google Play. The next frontier? Blockchain. Our pilot case on NEAR Protocol allowed users to \"mint\" their CO2 savings, offering a proof of concept that validates our ambitious vision. But to bring this to a larger audience, we need to develop it on Ethereum.\nThe grant would serve as the rocket fuel for our developers, propelling us to the next stage where every carpool is not just a shared ride but a shared investment in a greener future.\nIn a remarkably short span, our endeavors have been consistently recognized and celebrated by the global community.

He claimed that carbon sequestration was a \u201clazyboy\u201d way to make money with little effort. He bought 100 hectares of deciduous forest land in Northern Russia and planted fast-growing birch trees, which are not indigenous to the area. To make way for the new trees, he cut down rich biodiversity, leading to the destruction of the local ecosystem. The situation was worsened by the use of fertilizers and other short-term solutions, which caused soil erosion, over-extraction of the water table, and displacement of local species.\n\nTraditional Impact Metrics that use simple quantities like carbon credits incentivize such behavior that can have devastating long term consequences.

The answer to this question is usually pretty uncontentious; it\u2019s the reconciliation of ontology and epistemology. So what can we learn about these fields? Plenty for sure but let\u2019s keep things high level for now build our fundamental proposition from some general statements:\nOntology is about the specific nature of being\nEpistemology is about the general nature of knowing\nInterestingly, many long standing wisdom traditions are densely codified and you need not look too far to find this out whether christian, buddhist or hindu. Yes, they use their own domain specific terminology (ontology) but the form of their transmissions are nearly always geometric (epistemology).\nFrom these two areas we can continue with deductive reasoning through the garden of forking paths. The dyad of ontology and epistemology is triplicated into the classic Trivium of logic, grammar and rhetoric. Most LLMs are trained on such a corpus.\nExpanding further we get the classic Quadrivium of maths, music, geometry, astronomy. In the west the trivium and quadrivium have traditionally been considered the seven liberal arts to inner and outer perfection. We could further bifurcate these terms into higher resolution systems, but what of tantric Yoga? Or other wisdom traditions? Yes, they seem to build their own metaphysics through similar \u2018stacked geometries\u2019 and \u2018knowledge graphs\u2019.\nSince the last round we\u2019ve concentrated on filling out this high level picture and increasing their resolution at more fundamental levels.

Good question. Let me ask what do you really know about ecology and how do you know it? Or permaculture? How do you frame and validate a methodology to know its actually effective?\nPermaculture for example has three fundamental principles; earth care, people care, fair share - but what do we validate these values against? An answer of monitoring, verification and reporting might suffice for some, but precisely what kinds? Sky, ground, human, reputational sensing? And just to throw a wrench in the works, should we really go with the permaculture principles or ESGs? The answer is of course contextual is a matter of subjective ontology.\nCan we sort this mess out with technical infrastructure?

It follows that without a theft protection it all will be stolen and therefore all this makes no sense.\nThe smart contract \"Carbon Flow\" allows to limit amounts of carbon transfers between carbon accounting organizations (absolutely or per a time-frame) using ERC-1155 technology. This helps against theft. (If one carbon token is compromised, the entire system isn't, it continues to work, you just switch to another notary for accounting.)

It provides transparent and engaging access to reef restoration by linking dynamic digital assets to the API of the AI Coral Husbandry Automated Raceway Machine (CHARM). Allowing users real time data updates of coral growth, transplant locations and overall individualised coral health. Fostering a unique and direct connection to each and every coral lovingly grown by donors. Each digital asset will allow individual donors the ability to view, feed, and interact with their specific coral while providing real time data including and the amount of carbon sequestered.\nCHARM: Developed by the Beyond Coral Foundation, CHARM is a groundbreaking innovation in coral production, which is of vital importance to aquaculture particularly in environments that have suffered coral loss through ecological degradation. It merges machine automation with scientific techniques to cultivate coral at scale. CHARM's features include machine vision learning, robotic end effectors, AI-driven management of coral polyps, and an intuitive user interface. Our goal is to set up multiple locations across the world with Coral Connect and CHARM to create an engaging form of coral regeneration.\nThe specific challenge this proposal aims to accomplish, is to create a new gold standard for reef restoration, the process is two-fold:\nIncrease philanthropic engagement by providing transparency, awareness and tailored user experiences of reef restoration efforts.\nImprove the inefficiencies of current coral reef restoration methods via direct application.\ntwitter:NotEssential_io", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 1637, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19d1a589-b16b-4ecc-92a6-1c7675ec3c78": {"__data__": {"id_": "19d1a589-b16b-4ecc-92a6-1c7675ec3c78", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "AgroforestDAO", "url": "https://agroforestdao.web.app/", "contact": "twitter:agroforestdao", "location": "location:  city='' country='New Zealand' continent='Oceania'", "document_title": "\"Building a Sustainable Future: The Redemption Hill Agroforestry Community with Hypercerts, NFTs, and Hatsprotocol\"", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

Our comprehensive services include beekeeping training, expert consultations, bee health assessments, practical workshops, hive setup assistance, and guidance in honey harvesting to name a few. Through these initiatives, we empower individuals to become skilled beekeepers, promoting the well-being of bees and their environment while generating sustainable income.\n\nIn the past two years since its inception, Pollen Buzz Initiative has made significant strides towards its mission of promoting beekeeping education and sustainability in South India. We successfully conducted pilot beekeeping training programs in select communities, training a total of 250 individuals in various aspects of beekeeping.\n\nVenugopal, a farmer from Chitavalli village faced challenges in his Areca nut garden, experiencing significant flower and nut drop, resulting in lower profits, unable to pay back government loans. When invited by us for a free Beekeeping Training Program, he immediately seized the opportunity. After two days of theoretical and three days of practical training, he learned about rearing bees, hive management, honey production, and more.\nWith one set of apparatus provided by us (bee box, stand, and bee colony), Venugopal set up a bee box in his Areca garden. After 4 to 5 months, he started harvesting honey as a byproduct. Notably, he observed a gradual decrease in flower and nut drop compared to the previous year. Encouraged by this success, he obtained additional bee boxes from friends at the Horticulture Department and the Forest Department, now manages eight boxes in his garden. He produces 8 to 10 kg of honey per box annually.\nIncome from Honey: Rs. 16,000 per year (20 kg at \u20b9800 per kg)\nAreca Yield: Increased by 30 quintals after keeping bee boxes, benefiting both Venugopal and as well as his neighbouring farmers.\n\nBrahmaiah, a young farmer from Dasarahalli village, aspired to enhance onion seed production through beekeeping.

They are driven by a desire to contribute to environmental sustainability.\nSpeculators: This group includes investors and traders who are interested in purchasing eco assets with the intention of reselling them later at a premium to medium and long-term buyers. They see immediate opportunity in the market and are ready to invest in eco assets for future gains.\n\u25feMedium-term stakeholders: Commodity Producers and Insurance Providers\nCommodity Producers: These stakeholders view regenerative practices as a means of risk mitigation. Climate change poses existential threats to supply chains, and regenerative practices can increase biodiversity and ecosystem resilience, decreasing the risk of climate disruption. Commodities like Coffee, Olive Oil, Cacao, Citrus Fruits, Hemp, and others could be sold at a premium with proof-of-impact or eco assets attached to them.\nInsurance Providers: Similar to commodity producers, insurance providers see value in regenerative practices for risk mitigation. The ecological data collected through regenerative practices can be resold to insurance underwriters to better predict natural disaster impacts.\n\u2b1b Long-term stakeholders: Corporates and Governments\nCorporates and Governments: These entities are currently focusing more on Insetting (changing operations to reduce negative environmental impact) rather than Offsetting (buying eco assets that offset negative impact). There is a lack of clarity on what qualifies as Offsetting, and global standards bodies and government regulators need to achieve clarity on acceptable ecological assets. However, many corporations and governments have set sustainability goals for 2030 and 2040. As these dates approach, and if these organizations have not entirely reduced their negative impacts, they will need to purchase offsets to achieve goals like net-zero emissions.

Monthly Earth Day is a global movement I created Sept 22, 2022 that had resulted in over 30K trees planted and over 1K lbs of trash cleaned up in 1 year. The goal is to grow the community worldwide and on-boarding new web3 users while directly making the world a better place.\nPurpose\nThe next time you drive or walk somewhere, look around and notice the trash that is laying around. This is a major problem in some areas of the world. The trash has a negative impact and needs to be helped greatly.\nWith help, I am aiming to grow the global community and expand our impact even further through collaborations and partnerships to put on large clean up/ tree planting events. These events will also act as a bridge to on-board new people into web3 through help with setting up a wallet and earning crypto or NFTs for impact.\nUse of Grant Funds\nI would be able to use the funds to help with hosting/collaborating clean up events\nTarp Signs for the clean up events\nSupply green clean up bags for participants\nExtra trash grabbers\n1 Year Results\nGrow participants monthly to 100+\n30,000+ trees planted\n1,000+ lbs trash cleaned up\n2,500+ Matic donated to environmental charities\nMonthly Earth Day Growth\nFuture Impact\nContinue to grow the MED community participation each month to grow the global impact.\nSubmit pictures of impact through an on chain option (evergreen coin, litter token, greenzone with superworld app, etc.) for proof and measurement of results.\nPartnerships and collaborations on events will help with education and awareness as well as on-boarding new people into web3/refi.\nRebuild my discord to help reward submitting proof of impact and doing good deeds.\nUpdate website to show Monthly Earth Day impact.\nAbout The Founder\nNick\nMy name is Nick and I am big on nature and wildlife.

By combining innovative waste & sustainable management strategies with the transparency and security of blockchain technology, we intend to contribute to a more sustainable and regenerative future.\nTanzania, like many other regions, faces significant challenges related to waste management and environmental degradation. Improper disposal of waste contributes to pollution, health hazards, and ecological damage. At the heart of it all, Waste pickers are the ones that do all the off-setting however face many challenges such as lack of resources, negative societal stigma, and most importantly exploitation in pay where they receive a mere $0.1 per kilogram of waste! Additionally, the lack of transparent financial systems often hinders sustainable development efforts. Our project addresses these issues by creating a waste regeneration system that not only reduces waste but also provides economic incentives through blockchain-powered finance mechanisms.\nFurthermore, Tanzania's development index is closely tied to energy supply, and with the rapid depletion of non-renewable resources, an energy crisis looms. Over 95% of Tanzanian households rely on firewood and charcoal for cooking, revealing a significant market demand for cleaner energy sources.\nProject Solution:\nOur project's core solution involves the establishment of an infrastructure for waste regeneration that enables incentivizing regenerators in the form of waste pickers, transforming waste materials into valuable resources and enabling different organizations and businesses to keep track of their impact. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Blockchain, dmrv and efficient recycling processes, we aim to minimize waste accumulation and its negative impact on the environment.\n\nFurthermore, we integrate blockchain technology to ensure transparent tracking of waste transformation processes and provide financial and governance rewards to participants who contribute to the system.\nProject Goals:\nEnvironmental Regeneration: Reduce waste accumulation, minimize pollution, and promote sustainable resource management through the production and use of eco-products, solar micro-grids in the near future to ensure as much sustainability and climate friendly as possible.\nBlockchain Integration & Onboarding to Web3: Implement a secure and transparent blockchain system to track waste regeneration processes, decentralized storage onboard waste pickers to web3 directly and incentivize participants", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 2765, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3152b458-98ee-4a59-9af2-9199f86069a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "3152b458-98ee-4a59-9af2-9199f86069a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "ReFi Tanzania", "url": "https://www.chatafisha.com/", "contact": "twitter:ReFiTanzania", "location": "location:  city='' country='New Zealand' continent='Oceania'", "document_title": "\"Empowering Waste Pickers and Building a Sustainable Future in Tanzania: Regenerative Finance, Blockchain Integration, and Community Engagement for Environmental Regeneration in Waste Management\"", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

Since GR15 the WaterDAO has grown quickly. The WaterDAO has begun multiple research projects such as credit class development, solvent extraction desalination testing, and Solar energy desalination analysis tool feasibility. The WaterDAO has one live pilot project that it supported that is treating septic waste for reuse. A credit class and methodology are currently in their final stages of review with the Regen Network for water credit production. These credits will have significant co-benefits like carbon reductions and improved soil health.\nWork has begun towards creating an on chain monitoring system for water producers. As the DAO grows the goal is to continue to find more ways to add transparency to credits and automate the verification process on chain.\nThe purpose of the WaterDAO is to create transparency around sources of water, how they are generated, and establish a water credit classification system. We believe this can be done by creating a trustworthy and verifiable water credit that can be easily purchased and used to offset water usage. This would allow companies to continue to focus on their operational efficiencies while supporting the replacement of their water usage with equally efficient water producers.\nThe purpose of the WaterDAO can be summed up through four main goals:\nCreate a universally accepted water credit that is first supported by the Regenerative Finance (ReFi) community and eventually, by larger outside organizations. This credit class can serve as a building block for many types of water credits to be created.\nThe WaterDAO will act as a support mechanism to verify credit quality. The DAO will oversee specific verification standards to provide a certain level of quality, standard for the credits issued through the DAO.\nIncentivize companies to be \"Water Positive\" or at lease Water Neutral. This will come as the DAO expands and gains more influence. The DAO will make the process of becoming \"Water Positive\" a significantly easier process than it was previously, leaving companies fewer excuses to maintain their indifference.\nIncentivize more environmentally friendly forms of desalination and other water treatments.

In the future RH2O tokens will serve as water contracts where physical water can be collected. In addition, the physical mining of water ensures that the creation (supply) of water credits is limited by the capacity to generate physical water and the value of each RH2O token is a function of the balance between supply (miners) and demand (users).\nThe WaterDAO will have specific credit classes based on the Regen Network that water producers must fall under in order to produce a specific credit.

Silvi, ReFi DAO, and Traditional Dream Factory have claimed a large percentage of the hypercert, playing vital roles in making the planting a reality.\nTraditional Dream Factory is committed to nurturing and caring for these trees, ensuring their growth. ReFi DAO organized and orchestrated the entire initiative. Silvi purchased the trees and incorporated MRV tools to make this possible.\n\nHypercert image from the tree planting\nSilvi embarked on an exciting mission, combining human and drone sensing to capture vivid snapshots of newly planted trees. They collected images, attributes, and geolocations, going beyond the ordinary. Not stopping there, a breathtaking drone flyover revealed even more. All this invaluable data will be stored in a cutting-edge data claim resolution NFT, seamlessly linking to hypercert for undeniable impact verification.\nImagine a world where Hypercerts were not only minted but also carried rights like carbon credits. Exciting retroactive funders even more! They would eagerly seek information about carbon sequestered by planted trees over time and generously fund evaluators like Silvi. Best part: by purchasing fractions of Hypercerts, funders could directly benefit from carbon rights. The funding would flow to creators at Traditional Dream Factory, who could distribute it to deserving organizations like ReFiDAO and Silvi.\nCarbon is missing out on the big picture when it comes to acknowledging the positive impact of tree planting.

Monitoring is the process of measuring the total ecosystem and social services provided by the project. Measurements may be collected through satellite, IOT, georeferenced imagery from boots on the ground, as well as surveys that empower experts & citizen scientists. Reporting involves describing i) measured data, ii) the methodologies that were used to collect and analyze the data, and iii) potential biases as well as assumptions that went into the data collection/analysis. Verification refers to the review process involving a third party that is utilized to ensure the confidence in the validity of the uploaded data and methodologies.\nDecentralized measurement, reporting and verification (dMRV) means that no single entity will own, manage or regulate how MRV is done. Instead a collective of people from many different organizations can build upon and improve this dMRV system.

Yet carbon markets themselves face a number of fundamental challenges currently hindering their impact and growth - opacity, misinformation, extraction, fragmentation and the resulting lack of trust - to name a few... Furthermore, it is abundantly clear that carbon remains only one part of the challenge.

In the EU, almost 63% of total household energy is used for heating, while in the US, it's about 43%.\nIn addition, data centers and crypto miners already consume 2% of the world's electricity. 40% of it is used for cooling, which is enough energy to heat millions of homes or offices.\nFuroa is a symbiosis of two products: a supercomputer disguised as a heating system and a decentralized cloud compute platform. It's built for high-performance compute tasks like AI training/inference, rendering CGI, performing simulations, processing audio/video data, or running crypto staking nodes.\nUnlike existing cloud compute services, Furoa wastes no energy on cooling and doesn't require building huge data centers or hiring thousands of maintenance workers. That makes it a cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution.\n\nOur vision is for millions of spaces worldwide to be heated using Furoa. With every additional space the combined processing power and degree of redundancy will increase\u2014but most importantly, the cheaper access to high-performance computing will become.\nWe deeply believe that a global computing platform should be built by its community. That's why Furoa's operating system will be open-source once the software and hardware has been battle-tested.\nAll funds we receive will go towards prototype development.\n\ud83d\ude4f Help accelerate the transition to sustainable heating and decentralized computing by supporting the development of Furoa.\n\ud83d\udc49 Learn more on furoa.co and follow us @FuroaCo.\ntwitter:FuroaCo", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 1816, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3bc5b012-f881-4418-b867-c8a97fa8e1b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "3bc5b012-f881-4418-b867-c8a97fa8e1b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "ECORISE", "url": "https://ecorise.vercel.app/", "contact": "twitter:ECORISEFINANCE", "location": "location:  city='' country='New Zealand' continent='Oceania'", "document_title": "\"ECORISE: Revolutionizing Impact Investing through Tokenization, ReFi, and Eco Credits\"", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

In this plan, child will take care of the trees they plant up to maturity: adopt a tree! This will be coupled with education on climate change and proper soil maintenance practices.\nProblem statement\nThe members of the target community are in dire need to develop and increase their forest cover and secure their water catchment areas and improve their soil conservation. Lack of requisite education and information is the main hinderance to these\nProject Justification\nThe main target of this project is to increase the tree cover and imparting climate education to the young population so that we have climate conscious generation.\nThis is an environmental program that is designed as a means of conserving the environment with particular emphasis to schools and the communities around them. This program has among its components, issues that address health, water and sanitation, environmental awareness, tree planting with particular emphasis to multipurpose trees and species especially fruit trees for nutrition in schools and woody trees for the community.\nThe overall target is engaging all schools in this program\nProject objective:\nThe overall objective of this project is to increase tree cover while providing generations of children with healthy nutrition options and environmental education\nSpecific Objectives\n\u2022 To plant different species of trees in schools and the surrounding community\n\u2022 To pass on environment education for protection of our environment.\n\u2022 To provide good learning environments for children\nProject justification\nEngaging primary schools in planting trees will see us reach many people both in the schools and around the community. When all the children are engaged in adopting trees, it will ensure that most of the trees survive to maturity and in so doing, there will be increase in tree cover.

Northern Nigeria is no exception to this.\nExtreme weather patterns\u2014fiercer, longer dry seasons and shorter, more intense rainy seasons\u2014are exacerbating challenges confronting local communities. Extensive cultivation and overgrazing have been compounded by desertification, soil erosion, and other environmental problems that have affected the livelihoods of people living in the region\nProblem\nContinuous deforestation is happening in Northern Nigeria because of the need for food, medicine, charcoal, and timber. The loss of tree cover in a rainy, mountainous area has had severe environmental consequences. In addition to tremendous loss of biodiversity, the region experiences soil degradation, erosion, desertification and landslides.\nSpecific focus with this grant funding\nOur goal is to plant 1 million trees in Northern Nigeria by 2030 through our school campaign program that is aimed to reach 10,000 students in the region. We will achieve this by partnering with local organizations, schools, and communities to promote tree planting and environmental conservation. We will also provide educational resources and training to teachers and students to help them understand the importance of environmental conservation. Our specific focus is on empowering school children on tree planting\nSolution\nClimate change is a global challenge that requires collective action to mitigate its effects. One way to address this issue is through tree planting and school campaigns. By providing environmental skills and knowledge to rural school children, the children will be empowered to protect their local environment.\nWhy we need your Support\nOur vision is to create a sustainable future for generations to come by promoting tree planting and school campaigns. We believe that by planting trees, we can help to mitigate the effects of climate change and create a more sustainable environment. We also believe that by raising awareness about environmental conservation through school campaigns, we can inspire young people to take action and make a positive impact on the world.\nBecause of the awareness created by this project, the children and the community will learn to nurture the trees, and not cut them down. The knowledge of planting and protecting the trees will be passed on to the next generations. If this project succeeds, we will identify additional sectors in which trees can be planted, and spread our good work.\ntwitter:greateddydon", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 2553, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac1d394a-06cc-4ae4-9f8a-b4146d4735e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac1d394a-06cc-4ae4-9f8a-b4146d4735e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "$REGEN Tokenomics Working Group", "url": "https://www.notion.so/maxplay/REGEN-Tokenomics-Hub-126c4daf3da04966bdba76ab815e0696?pvs=4", "contact": "twitter:regen_network", "location": "location:  city='' country='New Zealand' continent='Oceania'", "document_title": "\"Regenerative Economy: Tokenomics, Governance, and Technology in the Regen Network\"", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

Your generous donation can make a real difference in the lives of those who are struggling with food insecurity in our community.\nIn Colorado, a staggering 42% of food in retail chains ends up as waste, primarily due to overproduction. Limited store space, high consumer demands, and the pursuit of perfect-looking products contribute to this issue.\nUnsold food, amounting to over 80 billion pounds annually in America, is discarded in landfills. According to the nonprofit ReFED, more than a third of all food grown for human consumption in the United States never reaches a plate. This wasted food represents $408 billion worth of resources, grown on 18% of U.S. farmland and using 4 trillion tons of water.\nWe envision a world where no one goes hungry, and food is used wisely.

However, citizens and companies outside the space sector are also extremely dependent on satellite capabilities to maintain their social, economic, political and environmental activities. How can we help them become aware of the consequences of orbital pollution, and give them the means to defend their own interests in outer space?\nC4H's approach responds to the challenges of space debris by empowering citizens and companies outside the space sector. Considering that we all have the right to benefit from Earth\u2019s Orbit, as much as the duty, in maintaining environmentally and economically sustainable access to space.\nIf we all consume satellite data, then we are all responsible for preserving the orbital environment.\nAs part of a partnership with the French Space Agency (CNES), Cosmos for Humanity has conceptualised an indicator, the Outer Space Footprint (OSF). Like the energy performance indicator, the OSF gives citizens and businesses the opportunity to defend their interests in space by encouraging or sanctioning the behaviour of space operators and their customers through their choice of consumption and suppliers.\n\nC4H proposes that the OSF be adopted as the European Standard for Space Sustainability and that its display be made mandatory for all products and services directly or indirectly related to space. C4H is also campaigning for the preservation of Earth's orbits to be recognised as the 7th Environmental Objective of the European Green Taxonomy and for the obligation for European companies to document their environmental impact to be extended to their footprint on the orbital environment, under the NFRD/CSRD directives.\nAs a complement to the OSF, C4H is running a collaborative label project designed to democratise the concept of space environmentalism. The aim is to enable as many people as possible to make a direct contribution to preserving our orbits by analysing and evaluating companies' policies on space sustainability.

These zones and forest frontiers hold significant potential for conservation in Laos, serving as a crucial instrument for ensuring connectivity between National Protected Areas (NPAs) and safeguarding more localized ecological assets, such as sub-catchments, small forest patches, and community forests. However, these areas face substantial challenges and pressure. Provincial and district authorities tasked with protecting these zones lack the capacity, resources, and enforcement power, resulting in the absence of a sustainable management system and enforceable protection. These areas are often perceived as free and open spaces where uncontrolled and unsustainable agricultural practices take place.Situated near Sayaboury town, Nam Tien Provincial Protected Area spans 6,000 hectares and has been home to the Elephant Conservation Center (ECC) since 2010. While the Nam Tien area may not inherently possess high biodiversity value, it provides a secure habitat for 10% of the country's captive elephant population through the ECC. Despite sporadic forest clearing for shifting cultivation by nearby communities, new encroachments are occurring for larger-scale agriculture, such as bananas and watermelon. Additional disturbances, like Karaoke boats on the lake, are increasing, underscoring the vulnerability of conservation measures when faced with more lucrative businesses. Maintaining a healthy captive elephant population in Laos is considered crucial, both by the Government of Laos and the conservation community, as it represents a vital resource to supplement the remaining wild elephant population in the adjacent National Park.

During the summer of 2019-20, Australia was hit hard by the most catastrophic bushfire season in its history. Up to 46 million acres were burnt and an estimated 3 billion animals were impacted. Moreover, every year, an estimated 12 million acres (approximately the size of the U.S states of Vermont and New Hampshire combined) of native forests and woodlands are cleared across Australia, leading to Australia being listed as one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deforestation hotspots and the only developed nation on WWF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2021 deforestation fronts list.  Over 700 native plant and animal species are threatened by forest habitat destruction. This includes the iconic koala, which was recently up-listed from Vulnerable to Endangered and is facing extinction by 2050. In the wake of the fires, WWF-Australia launched Regenerate Australia, to rehabilitate and restore wildlife and habitats and build resilience against climate disasters. WWF aims to end deforestation, transition from unsustainable logging, promote deforestation-free agriculture, return state land to indigenous management, and restore degraded koala habitats.Scope of WorkWith support from HP, WWF is working to save, protect and restore more than 53,000 acres (21,500 hectares) of forest in eastern Australia. This includes improving policy conditions, improving forest management, halting deforestation, and restoring degraded landscapes by transitioning from unsustainable native forestry to sustainable plantations, control excessive tree clearing on agriculture land, and restore koala habitat and support nature based solutions like green firebreaks to manage bushfire risk.\n{'user': 'Amelia Meadows', 'envelope': 'amelia.meadows@wwfus.org'}", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1808, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3992ac9-ae69-4cdb-bc9f-791bc0cad1fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "e3992ac9-ae69-4cdb-bc9f-791bc0cad1fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "The Central West Mexico Biocultural Corridor (COBIOCOM)", "url": "https://explorer.land/x/project/cobiocom/", "contact": "{'user': 'Samuel Herculano', 'envelope': 'samuel@reforestamos.org', 'phone': '(+52) 553-1453590', 'link': 'https://www.reforestamosmexico.org/'}", "location": "Western Mexico,Mexico", "document_title": "Collaborative Framework Agreements for Ecosystem Management and Biodiversity Conservation in Central Western Mexico's Subnational Governments", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

In partnership with Wild Bird Trust\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cape Parrot Project in the Eastern Cape of South Africa, the Greenpop Foundation has been reforesting patches of degraded Amatole forest since 2019. By planting indigenous trees, this work serves to restore and expand the habitat of the endangered Cape Parrot.Conservation Problem StatementThe Cape Parrot is threatened mainly by habitat loss and disease, with only around 1,800 individuals left in the wild. They, along with many other species, are dependent on Mistbelt forest habitat. However, this habitat near Hogsback, Eastern Cape, has been degraded by historical indigenous tree felling and lost by the conversion of indigenous forest to exotic pine plantations, with forest margins also affected by alien invasive plants. The Department of Environment, Fisheries and Forestry is mandated to restore this land, but is severely under-resourced. Villages and small communities surrounding these Mistbelt forests depend on the forests for firewood, housing materials and bushmeat.Restoration ApproachGreenpop\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed solution to the problem of forest degradation is to assist in restoring forest ecosystem function and biodiversity through reforestation.  Therefore, this project utilises the Forest Landscape Restoration approach, which is the ongoing process of regaining ecological functionality and enhancing human well-being across deforested or degraded forest landscapes.

Due to the adverse soil conditions created by the alien vegetation on-site, swales will be reconstructed to assist in water catchment and infiltration and a strong focus will be placed on planting fast-growing pioneer species, such as Keurboom (Virgillia oroboides), that have proven very successful within the larger project at Khoinania. Roughly 60-70% of the trees to be planted, will be Keurboom, to promote shade and environmental protection for slower-growing species.

Containing six-million acres, the Park is the largest park in the contiguous United States. It covers one-fifth of New York State, is equal in size to neighboring Vermont, and is nearly three times the size of Yellowstone National Park.The Adirondack Park is best known for its expansive pristine forests, lakes, rivers, and outdoor recreation opportunities. Unlike a national park, the Adirondack Park has no entrance and no entry fee, as it not only contains public land, but private lands as well where people live year-round.The Adirondack Park is unique in that it's a mix of private and state-owned land.

We recognize that we can never return this landscape to its original state, because of climate change, but we are determined to \"be kind to the survivors\" and ensure the area is large enough to ensure the survival of what biodiversity remains into perpetuity. Our solution is to work together to preserve the biodiversity of ACG through biodevelopment, world class science, bioliteracy education for children, protection of our extraordinary marine and coastal resources, and targeted land acquisition from willing sellers. Large, complex and socially-integrated protected areas do not take care of themselves and public budgets are often not enough to take care of the need. GDFCF adds critical capacity to ACG in numerous areas to ensure the mission of biodiversity survival is realized.\n{'user': 'Monique Gilbert', 'envelope': 'monique@gdfcf.org', 'link': 'https://www.gdfcf.org/'}", "start_char_idx": 1420, "end_char_idx": 3507, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "45cd8f02-3b35-4a76-b11f-dfe01b3847bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "45cd8f02-3b35-4a76-b11f-dfe01b3847bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "Arresting Forest Degradation by Addressing Firewood Consumption", "url": "https://explorer.land/x/project/afdafc/", "contact": "{'user': 'Purva Varyar', 'envelope': 'purva@wctindia.org', 'link': 'https://www.wildlifeconservationtrust.org/', 'earth-americas': '11th floor, Mafatlal Centre, Nariman Point Mumbai, Maharashtra, 400021 India'}", "location": "Chandrapur District, Maharashtra,India", "document_title": "Sustainable Solutions for Forest Degradation, Health Impacts, Water Heating, Firewood Extraction, and Wildlife Conservation in Indian Villages", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

Extreme weather, long and strenuous patrolling regime, and encounters with armed poachers lead to high incidences of stress-related diseases. Apart from exposure to communicable diseases such as malaria, forest staff are also vulnerable to chronic non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. The remoteness of their locations, coupled with lack of affordable and quality healthcare, exacerbates the problem.WCT addresses this problem by conducting health check-up camps and providing preventive healthcare to frontline forest staff, free of cost. The initiative is being conducted in partnership with Tulsi Foundation, UK.Forest staff receives:\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tScreening for non-communicable disease risk factors such as raised blood glucose, abnormal lipids, raised blood pressure, use of tobacco, use of alcohol, etc.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tBlood pressure check, measurement of height and weight to calculate BMI, and measurement of waist circumference.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tBasic pathology investigations including haemoglobin levels, HbA1c, liver profile, lipid profile, etc.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tScreening for Hepatitis B & C.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tECG test for those identified with cardio-vascular risk factors.These screenings allow WCT health teams to identify officials with chronic or serious illnesses, who are then advised to seek further treatment.Recently, the team concluded the three-year long (2016-2019) survey, in what is the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largesthealth needs assessment survey of frontline forest staff, covering nearly 1,400 frontline forest staff across 18 PAs in central India.

These skills prove invaluable for the forest staff posted at remote locations with limited availability of healthcare services.WCT conducts one-day training sessions for frontline forest staff to impart basic-first aid and trauma management techniques. The training includes an overview of trauma-care, guidance on methods to deal with emergencies such as injuries due to animal or human attacks, vehicular trauma, fall from a height, snake and scorpion bites, burns and heat-strokes, high-grade fevers, epilepsy attacks and other medical emergencies. Group exercises in simulated field settings provide a hands-on experience for the forest staff.Over 1,200 frontline forest staff from 17 PAs in the Central Indian Landscape have been trained under the programme. A survey of the staff revealed that at least one in ten forest staff have faced serious trauma due to accidents, major injuries and animal attacks (including snake bites) while working in the field, from where even basic medical care was more than 30 km away.WCT has also developed and distributed a \u00e2\u0080\u0098First Aid Field Guide for Forest Staff\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that provides a ready-reference for managing emergencies which they are likely", "start_char_idx": 1508, "end_char_idx": 3801, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a907544-7176-4289-9fef-3a5ba69e987c": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a907544-7176-4289-9fef-3a5ba69e987c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "Caring For Conservators Programme", "url": "https://explorer.land/x/project/caring_for_conservators/", "contact": "{'user': 'Purva Variyar', 'envelope': 'purva@wctindia.org', 'link': 'https://www.wildlifeconservationtrust.org/'}", "location": "Multiple locations across the country,India", "document_title": "Enhancing Health and Safety for Frontline Forest Staff: Comprehensive Trauma Management Training and Policy Recommendations in Central India", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

Although, these annual inundations play a significant role in maintaining the fertility of the habitat, they also regularly cause large scale temporary displacement of wild animals.With an average altitude of 60m, the park offers very little escape for animals during the floods. Although man-made highlands offer some relief to animals, many get washed away. Animals also get displaced in their attempt to escape to higher ground, with young ones who are unable to keep pace with their parents often getting left behind.Beyond the park boundary, displaced animals are susceptible to conflict with humans and sometimes fall prey to poachers. Many also fall victims to road accidents, especially along NH37 that separates Kaziranga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s low-lying flooded grasslands from the wooded highlands of the Karbi Anglong hills to the south.

Since most nesting beaches in Odisha are affected by factors that endanger nesting turtles, eggs and hatchlings. As per study, only 1 in 1000 hatchlings survives to adulthood. To counter the high mortality rate and low survival rate, these gentle species have been pushed towards the brink of extinction. This high mortality rate is driven by factors such as predation as well as anthropogenic activities. Nests are damaged by changing tides and beach erosion, and eggs are consumed by predators.

Free-roaming grazing animals - cattle, ponies, pigs and deer - drive this process-led regeneration. They act as proxies for herbivores that would have grazed the land thousands of years ago. Their different grazing preferences are creating a mosaic of habitats - from grassland and scrub to open-grown trees and wood pasture.Knepp has seen extraordinary increases in wildlife since rewilding began. Extremely rare species such as turtle doves, nightingales, peregrine falcons and purple emperor butterflies are now breeding here. Populations of more common species are rocketing.Knepp demonstrates that low-cost methods of ecological restoration can be highly effective, producing dramatic and profitable results for failing or abandoned farmland. It shows that rewilding projects can support established nature reserves and wildlife sites by providing an expansion of habitats and wildlife that will one day connect up on a landscape scale. It also supports new nature based enterprises, such as high quality meat, camping, glamping, safaris, and business rentals to create a resilient rural economy. This has improved business for local pubs, shops & B&Bs. The estate also has an extensive volunteer programme, education programme, and wellness programme including yoga.Kick-starting RewildingSheep and dairy cattle were removed and arable land was taken out of production.

The 300+ elephants roam a vast Sahelian landscape of >40,000 km2, which they share with approx. 500,000 people (pastoralists, agropastoralists and subsistence farmers for the majority).Threats & ChallengesBoth elephants and people depend on natural resources for their survival. However, increasing human pressure is driving natural habitat loss and degradation, exacerbating competition for natural resources (between people, as well as people and elephants), and reducing the resilience of the ecosystem to cope with environmental and social change. As well as endangering the survival of elephants, this is further impoverishing local livelihoods, in a context of extreme poverty and youth unemployment. An armed jihadist insurgency is also exacerbating social tensions, driving recruitment by armed groups, while rendering the area highly insecure.The MEP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ApproachThe project supports local communities of the elephant range in the development of \u00e2\u0080\u009celephant-centred\u00e2\u0080\u009d community-led natural resource management systems that protect and restore natural habitat, make space for elephants while supporting local livelihoods.The MEP helps local communities create governance structures to manage natural resources, enabled by national legislation, through facilitating dialogue between stakeholders, and the development of consensual, transparent and local solutions founded on the protection and restoration of natural habitat (pastures, forests, water) by local communities, supported by commune (county) authorities.Project ImpactThe resultant environmental governance systems help protect habitat and elephants; restore over-exploited, degraded ecosystems; improve local livelihoods; provide respected occupations for youths, helping to prevent urban migration and recruitment by armed groups; provide income-generating opportunities for women; and reinforce social cohesion through dialogue and collaboration. The result is a more resilient social and ecological system.The project\u00e2\u0080\u0099s integrated approach has meant that while the initial focus was on elephant conservation, it delivers multiple benefits, helping to address several problems, and contributes to several SDGs.

Additionally, looking at the average home range estimates of tigers and the size of Protected Areas, the future of tiger conservation and recovery is highly dependent on tiger habitats outside Protected Areas.Identifying forest blocks outside Protected Areas to ensure habitat connectivity for tigers is critical. It is important to plan conservation policies at the landscape level where both Protected Areas and corridors are given equal importance.This project seeks to upgrade the status of key tiger-bearing forest blocks outside Protected Areas in the Central Indian Landscape, through systematic, long-term monitoring of tigers and diet analysis to collect data on their densities and population dynamics in the region. Scientific analysis of the data collected thus, is proving to be crucial for influencing the larger tiger conservation policy framework at the landscape and national level. Other objectives include building the capacity of forest staff and other stakeholders in monitoring tiger populations outside Protected Areas; enabling the use of individual tiger-level data in human-tiger conflict resolution; assisting in planning mitigation measures for linear infrastructure; and monitoring dispersal of tigers.Camera trapping surveys from this project allow us to study the tiger populations as well as the extent of human pressure on these forests. The objective of this data analysis is to develop a data-driven policy report to identify the key ecological drivers of human-wildlife conflict in the various sites in the Central Indian Landscape and provide actionable insights to the government from our long-term tiger monitoring project.WCT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Conservation Research team is engaged in the following activities pertaining to the project:Camera trap surveys to estimate tiger densities.Scat collection for diet analysis to determine prey selection and the tigers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 dependence on livestock outside Protected Areas and along corridors.Capacity building among the frontline forest staff in monitoring tiger populations.\n{'user': 'Purva Variyar', 'envelope': 'purva@wctindia.org', 'link':", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2265, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ef94b6c-b27d-4a7f-8920-e2d2a14c8cca": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ef94b6c-b27d-4a7f-8920-e2d2a14c8cca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "Monitoring of Tiger Populations in the Central Indian Tiger Landscape", "url": "https://explorer.land/x/project/indian_tiger_monitoring/", "contact": "{'user': 'Purva Variyar', 'envelope': 'purva@wctindia.org', 'link': 'https://www.wildlifeconservationtrust.org/', 'earth-americas': 'Mafatlal Centre, 11th floor, Nariman point, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India'}", "location": "Central Indian Landscape,India", "document_title": "\"Conserving Tigers in Central India: Habitat Connectivity, Data-Driven Policies, and Insights on Human-Wildlife Conflict\"", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

Its southern boundary is the Cuttaburra Creek, and Yantabulla Swamp adjoins the property to the west.These wetlands are special. They sit in a flood zone where rainfall is very erratic, which means they're often dry for long periods.

Instituto Araguaia's headquarters is a field station in one of our PPAs, and our team of rangers/firefighters from the local community patrols and protects all our reserves year-round.

Yet as the occurrence of wild herbivore carcasses has declined, so these magnificent birds have become increasingly dependent on the carcasses of domesticated animals. Ever stricter veterinary regulations, however, mean this food source is also becoming increasingly unreliable.Working with local partners Rewilding Rhodopes is increasing the number of local ungulates through several annual red deer and fallow deer releases, with reintroduced animal behaviour monitored through the use of GPS collars. Since 2014, over 500 fallow deer and 100 red deer have been released.The number of griffon vulture pairs rose to 105 producing 72 juveniles (compared with 65 in 2018), that fledged successfully. Considerable time and effort has been investedin protecting this burgeoning colony, with 167 pylons insulated and fitted with flight diverters to prevent electrocution and collisions. In 2016 the first anti-poison dog unit also began patrolling the Rhodope Mountains helping to protect vultures by establishing poison-free areas.Together with partners, Rewilding Europe is creating space for natural processes like forest regeneration, free flowing rivers, herbivory and carnivory to impact ecosystems.

The solution is based on research and studies that allow for planning, diagnosis, training and advice for the installation of the gardens, technical assistance, monitoring, evaluation of indicators and reporting.

Rampant habitat loss in the region had exacerbated human-elephant conflict, with serious consequences for both communities and for elephants in the region.But more vitally, long before Balipara Foundation had begun engaging with communities in the region, a coalition of community members had come together to form the Bhairabkunda Joint Forest Management Committee in 2005 with a view to reforesting the Bhairabkunda Reserve Forest.

We can provide land ownership documentation and long term contracts.Our partnersAfrica\u00e2\u0080\u0099s small farmers are our most important cooperation partners. They grow nature-positive products, we invest in seeds, grant fair loans and ensure that the harvest grows year after year. All project activities are planned, managed and done by and with the indigenous communities. This means we can ensure acceptance, commitment and real impact according to the requirements of the local people.Local processingWorldwide, 400 million tonnes of cashews are produced every year, well over half of which come from Africa. However, only a fraction is processed in Africa. The same applies to other products. We process directly on site, create jobs and will invest in solar energy for processing. The stack of machines, tools and equipment will be a mix of low tech, high tech and manual work so that we can achieve efficiency and create jobs especially for women at the same time.

Currently, 74% of the forest has disappeared and the remaining 26% is severely degraded. The immediate consequence is erosion of topsoil and the significant reduction of agricultural yields for smallholder farmers. Even more alarming is the possible long-term impact on local cloud formation and rainfall, causing more frequent droughts and food insecurity.What will the project do?WeForest has been working since 2016 to directly restore and protect over 40,000 ha of the forest through Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR) and Enrichment Planting. We select species that serve multiple purposes to the forest and the communities, generating a combination of social, economic and environmental benefits. Examples are olive (Olea europaea), juniper (Juniperus procera) and briar root (Erica arborea), which are combined with different grass species for fodder and to reduce erosion. Furthermore, soil and water conservation structures are built to reduce run-offs and improve soil infiltration.Who benefits?By combining forest restoration with livelihood improvement programmes, we focus on improving natural resource governance and the socio-economic resilience of communities living in and around the forest, with a special focus on women, the landless, subsistence farmers and youth. Examples of activities are beekeeping, poultry, sheep, high-value trees and vegetable seeds, efficient cookstoves, solar lights and the employment of forest guards, as well as the establishment and strengthening of rural schools\u00e2\u0080\u0099 environmental clubs.\n{'user': 'WeForest', 'envelope': 'sponsorship@weforest.org', 'link': 'https://www.weforest.org/'}", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2080, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14a0c9f0-4ac5-45e1-8db0-a648da272ca1": {"__data__": {"id_": "14a0c9f0-4ac5-45e1-8db0-a648da272ca1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "Avoiding deforestation in Apu\u00c3\u00ad", "url": "https://explorer.land/x/project/weforest_apui/", "contact": "{'user': 'WeForest', 'envelope': 'sponsorship@weforest.org', 'link': 'https://www.weforest.org/'}", "location": "The Rio Juma settlement in the Apu\u00c3\u00ad municipality, Amazonas,Brazil", "document_title": "Sustainable Farming for Biodiversity Conservation and Climate Action in Apu\u00ed", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

The project will improve cattle ranching productivity and develop forest-friendly production systems, such as coffee agroforestry, to support the livelihoods of local families and avoid further deforestation. Forests on farmland will be restored with native trees.Around 160 landowners will participate. As well as agroforestry, some farms will be transformed into silvopastoral systems that integrate trees on pasture with cattle, using a pasture rotation technique that allows for an increase in production using less land.Farmers will receive technical support and training throughout the project to establish silvopastoral and agroforestry systems, as well as strengthening local expertise on forest restoration and sustainable farming.

Young plants are then dispatched to our farmer-partners on their lands. These plantations contribute to diversifying the sources of income for farmers through agroforestry: we are planting trees that will give fruitful harvest for our farmer-partners, benefitting them economically. We put local communities at the heart of our projects and we attach importance to the commitment of our partner farmers and beneficiaries. To maintain farmers' commitment, various initiatives have been put in place: awareness-raising, capacity building, income-generating activities, and improved access to basic services.Planting a seed represents 1% of our work, we commit to following all projects for 5 years, and to build a solid collaboration between operational teams and farmer-partners to support them build resilience, and better the trees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 survival rate.

In partnership with the Platbos Forest Reserve in the Western Cape of South Africa, the Greenpop Foundation has been reforesting and restoring Africa's southernmost forest since 2011. This work serves to restore forest habitat for many incredible species including theCape Leopard.Platbos Reserve, a relic forest withtrees of over 1000 years of age, is vulnerable to runaway fires. Indigenous forests are rare and endangered ecosystems coveringless than 0.05% of the Western Cape, and contain a wealth of biodiversity within its ancient embrace. The protection of the established forest, and the restoration of historically forested land back to forests, is of utmost importance in ensuring the continued survival ofAfrica's Southernmost Forest.Conservation Problem Statement:The Platbos Conservation Trust, through its Platbos Forest Restoration Project, aims to protect and restore the forest landscape in the Platbos Forest Reserve. This project, which was initiated in 2006 following significant wildfires in the Uilkraal Valley, includes activities to clear the alien vegetation which poses a fire threat to the forest and to reforest degraded forest patches with indigenous trees. In this way, not only is the fire risk to the forest reduced, but the forest itself, and the biodiversity it supports, is reintroduced back into the landscape.The Platbos Forest Restoration Project has been supported by Greenpop since 2011 and over 62,000 trees have been planted through this collaboration to date.Project Target AreasPlatbos Forest ReservePlatbos Forest occurs in deep sandy, alkaline soil on north-facing, gently undulating terrain.

Therefore, this project utilises the Forest Landscape Restoration approach, which is the ongoing process of regaining ecological functionality and enhancing human well-being across deforested or degraded forest landscapes. FLR is more than just planting trees \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it is restoring a whole landscape to meet present and future needs and to offer multiple benefits and land uses over time.Funding and implementation of actions to restore  degraded areas will eventually lead to improved forest management and associated co-benefits, such as :Biodiversity conservation through increasing habitat availability for forest-dependent speciesIncreased soil stability and healthImproved water regulationIncreased Carbon sequestrationEconomic benefits derived through eco-tourism and sustained forest productivityActivities1. Alien Vegetation Management:Sites are selected from across all 4 properties. These areas are then cleared of alien vegetation and prepared for planting.

The increasing demand for fish and other marine resources and the low capacity for management has resulted in overexploitation and degraded ecosystems. Overfishing and destructive fishing and the impacts of climate change exacerbates this challenge. The governance of small-scale fisheries in Kenya has also undergone a transformation towards co-management through the Beach Management Units (BMU) regulations. The co-management approach has the potential to provide positive ecological, social, cultural, economic and political outcomes. Potential benefits include livelihood and biodiversity sustainability, reduced conflicts and management costs, resolution of land tenure and access issues, and increased stewardship of biodiversity. However, although the BMU regulations empower BMUs to manage their fishing grounds, the capacity of communities to take on this new role is limited. In particular, SSF communities' ability to monitor and track their fishing activities (catch and incomes) has been shown to be an important limiting factor for effective co-management.WCS and ABALOBI ICT4Fisheries are currently leading a project on SSF management in one coastal community in the Diani-Chale marine reserve within the proposed Trans-Boundary Conservation Area (TBCA) between southern Kenya and northern Tanzania. The project addresses the primary challenge of low management capacity of the SSF communities in Kenya. The project aims to empower a community to collect fisheries and income data through smartphone technology to inform their management and business decisions. The project thus contributes to maintaining the critical ecosystems of the Kenyan coast and ensuring sustainable livelihoods for coastal communities.Learn more about the project by readingthis factsheet.Learn more about WCS' work in small-scale fisherieshere.\n{'user': 'Casha de Vos', 'phone': '+27 84 324 7560', 'link': 'https://abalobi.org/'}", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2103, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ef02f20a-ff2f-4bc2-8919-04dde7fd0026": {"__data__": {"id_": "ef02f20a-ff2f-4bc2-8919-04dde7fd0026", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "LOBI \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Assistant Bot for SSF", "url": "https://explorer.land/x/project/lobi/", "contact": "{'user': 'Angela Heyburgh', 'envelope': 'angela@abalobi.org'}", "location": "Africa,South Africa, Kenya, Seychelles", "document_title": "Empowering Small-Scale Fishers Globally Through Innovation, Inclusivity, Multilingual Support, and Sustainable Practices: The Impact of LOBI", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

These value added products are mainly produced and sold by women in coastal communities. The ABALOBI Pantry, developed in 2019 through a co-design process with women producers from coastal communities, provides an innovative revenue source for women fishers, offering a marketplace dedicated to communities selling products crafted from coastal harvested ingredients. These pockets of economic activity bring hope to impoverished communities where job opportunities are scarce. The ABALOBI Pantry operates as a limited online market, featuring coastal products crafted by women fishers. These products can be conveniently ordered through the ABALOBI Marketplace App, catering to chefs, delis, and individual buyers. Each product is fully traceable, accompanied by a QR code that narrates its origin and the artisans behind it.Developing the skills of the ABALOBI Pantry producers and providing capacity building opportunities is a priority for ABALOBI. ABALOBI addresses skills development by supporting business development initiatives with producers, driving internal and buyer feedback processes to inform product development; and developing standard operating procedures for producers to use when developing products.Furthermore, ABALOBI developed a basic training program destined to unlock entrepreneurship within fisherwomen. The program covers basic personal and kitchen hygiene, as well as preserving basics to utilise their traditional knowledge and cultural knowledge to sell value-add products.The advantages of this initiative include facilitating market access for producers, providing support in logistics and storage, offering a traceable platform for producers to share their stories and cultural knowledge, and offering training and capacity-building in business fundamentals and costings.\n{'user': 'Marketplace Admin', 'envelope': 'marketplace@abalobi.org', 'link': 'https://abalobi.org/'}", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2019, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "17f0525d-65dd-480c-9410-0311308c62a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "17f0525d-65dd-480c-9410-0311308c62a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "Butiama Hills", "url": "https://explorer.land/x/project/weforest-butiama/", "contact": "{'user': 'WeForest', 'envelope': 'sponsorship@weforest.org', 'link': 'https://www.weforest.org/'}", "location": "Mara,Tanzania", "document_title": "Restoring Ecosystems and Livelihoods in Butiama Hills, Tanzania: A Comprehensive Approach to Sustainable Development", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

It is also home to an important sub-population of jaguars, with around 90 individuals that live the Atlantic Forest of Alto Paran\u00c3\u00a1, shared by Argentina and Brazil. However, around 50% of the native forest is unprotected and located in a mosaic of plantations and pasturelands. Agriculture here is mainly dominated by perennial crops, particularly yerba mate, a native Atlantic Forest tree whose evergreen leaves produce a high-caffeine tea.Establishing wildlife corridorsThe project will engage 49 smallholder farmers to kickstart the transformation of the current agricultural model, promoting a forest-based production of yerba mate and improving water access and resources by restoring degraded sites, creating forest patches that connect the Yabot\u00c3\u00ad Biosphere Reserve with the Pi\u00c3\u00b1alito and Cruce Caballero Provincial Parks. By conserving, restoring and promoting sustainable use of the Atlantic Forest both here and in Pontal, Brazil, we can work towards a gene flow within two important sub-populations of jaguars.\n{'user': 'WeForest', 'envelope': 'sponsorship@weforest.org', 'link': 'https://www.weforest.org/'}", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1800, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9c5f5ef-4b7a-4b77-902a-063728a5ed74": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9c5f5ef-4b7a-4b77-902a-063728a5ed74", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "Orchard of Flavours \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Pomar dos Sabores", "url": "https://explorer.land/x/project/orchard-of-flavours/", "contact": "{'user': 'Miguel Cotton', 'envelope': 'miguel@orchardofflavours.com', 'phone': '+351915648264', 'link': 'https://www.orchardofflavours.com/'}", "location": "Faro, Algarve,Portugal", "document_title": "The Orchard of Flavours: Cultivating Diversity, Climate Resilience, and Community Knowledge Sharing", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

Land restoration and effective tree monitoring is important in line with the National Development Strategy 1 and the UNFCCC 2021-2030 as a decade of restoration.We have come up with The Greater Green Project, an initiative that aims to plant and monitor 1 billion trees (products) in Zimbabwe by 2030. We are leveraging Science, Technology and Innovation ie The Plant Master Software (tree monitoring services). The software is partitioned into Plant Notification, Plant Status, Plant Cancellation and Plant Yield, all tracking planted trees at different time intervals. With the software, we are able to estimate yield and carbon sequestration per tree and per hectar.Our customers are the Government and NGOs. They are involved in large scale reforestation programs and henceforth require quality trees and an effective tree monitoring system for the planted trees for accounting on survival, yield and carbon capture. These are located in Zimbabwe with prospects to go regional and international.Impact Targets:Trainings: Socially, we are aiming to train 2500 individuals tree propagation skills and training 50000 primary and secondary school students practical agroforestry skills and create 50000 job opportunities by 2030.Hectares of land restored: Environmentally, we are targeting to reverse 150 000ha (6%) of degraded land in Zimbabwe.

With its aim to protect the water resources of one the largest rivers in the state of S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo, the Tiet\u00c3\u00aa Forests project serves as the perfect opportunity to experiment with ways to reduce or eliminate the use of herbicides and pesticides by testing different spatial arrangements or species combinations, and developing best practices.To do this, the project adopts a three-pronged approach:The removal of grass prior to planting will be carried out mechanically by mowing.Green manure \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Guandu or pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 will be used in between native vegetation as an extra contribution to the fast-growing and large-crowned plants that shade and suppress invasive grasses, accelerating the growth of all native species.The biomass of both the mown grass and the green manure will be used as mulch during tree planting, also to stop invasive grasses growing again.\n{'user': 'WeForest', 'envelope': 'sponsorship@weforest.org', 'link': 'https://www.weforest.org/'}", "start_char_idx": 1517, "end_char_idx": 3501, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "146a3bb6-29fe-4c4c-8eb1-40e44b4dc9ba": {"__data__": {"id_": "146a3bb6-29fe-4c4c-8eb1-40e44b4dc9ba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "EcoLiNE GREENS Kikapu Enterprise", "url": "https://explorer.land/x/project/ecoline-greens/", "contact": "{'user': 'Peter Murage', 'envelope': 'moofafrica@gmail.com', 'phone': '+254-791 028 002', 'link': 'http://www.moofafrica.com/'}", "location": "Laikipia, Meru and Nyeri Counties,Kenya", "document_title": "Sustainable Agribusiness and Community Development Initiatives in Laikipia County, Kenya", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

Although net deforestation in the district is not high yet, it is widespread throughout, and is especially worrying inside the National Forest Reserve and along the rivers due to chitemene (slash-and-burn agriculture).The project area was selected for two reasons: the importance of the Luangwa River for the fishing and farming communities downstream, and its rich biodiversity, both on the massif and in the Luangwa river valley. Animals that call this forest home include samango monkeys, vervet monkeys, yellow baboons, side-striped jackals, spotted hyenas, wild cats, servals and leopards.

Their complex root systems protect coastal areas from storms and erosion, provide habitats for fish and shellfish that are important protein sources for local people, and sequester huge amounts of carbon that can fight climate change.Villages here rely on the mangroves to protect them from storms and support agriculture, fishing and seafood. The delta was seriously affected by a drought from 1968 to 1994, which killed the  mangroves in the higher parts of the mudflats. The mangroves were also chopped down for their wood, which is used for construction, firewood and charcoal for fish smoking and cooking. Without the mangroves, the coastal communities here are vulnerable to the loss of income from shellfish harvests, as well as to the destruction caused by storms.Amazing biodiversityThe Sine-Saloum delta is an exceptional territory that is classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Household incomes are low because of ever-diminishing harvests of fish and shellfish after the loss of their mangrove habitat. The communities here also rely heavily on farming, growing ground nuts, maize and rice and collecting wild honey.By bringing the biodiversity of the area back to a higher level, the project will boost fish stocks and create sustainable harvesting opportunities for fishing and shellfish collection on the tidal channels and mudflats.

WeForest trains farmers in restoring their small farms (1 or 2 ha on average) with indigenous and fruit trees.Ecological restorationThe project empowers farmers to restore miombo woodlots on their farmlands. Farmers with a minimum of one lima (0.25 hectares) of woodlot are recruited and trained in Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR), which involves protecting and nurturing wild tree seedlings. This process is carried out all year round and serves to promote the natural succession of the forest.Livelihood developmentFruit trees take a while to produce food or income, so farmers need short-term alternatives to replace the cash they used to get from charcoal, for example. Beehives help a lot, as they can double a household's annual income in some cases. Farmers are also trained in harvesting biomass from their woodlots through coppicing, a technique that involves extracting wood from tree stems while leaving the total number of trees intact, making it a sustainable alternative to charcoal production.\n{'user': 'WeForest', 'envelope': 'sponsorship@weforest.org', 'link': 'https://www.weforest.org/'}", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1566, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "45265924-1e54-4e4e-9d5d-3839c4fa56e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "45265924-1e54-4e4e-9d5d-3839c4fa56e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "The Generation Forest - Planting Permanent Forests in Panama", "url": "https://explorer.land/x/project/thegenerationforest/", "contact": "{'user': 'The Generation Forest', 'envelope': 'info@thegenerationforest.com', 'link': 'https://thegenerationforest.com/', 'earth-americas': 'Gro\u00c3\u009fe Elbstra\u00c3\u009fe 145a, 22767 Hamburg, Germany'}", "location": "Col\u00c3\u00b3n,Panama", "document_title": "Reforestation and Biodiversity Conservation in Panama: The Generation Forest's Sustainable Projects", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

Today we can observe a variety of local tree species that colonize the remaining gaps and the understory of the existing forest. We actively manage this regeneration to support the transformation of that project.In the beginning of 2019 we bought 148 hectares of land in the hilly land of the \"Sierra Llorona\" (the crying mountain ridge).

But the precipitation and the constant temperature make this region special: is is home to the most species-rich rainforests in Panama.Here we are reforesting with the generation forest model. Due to the relative proximity to the cities of Col\u00c3\u00b3n and Panama City, deforestation is increasing in this region.

This involves removing invasive species and materials and planting native trees around the resources to ensure their sustainable use.In order to achieve this  and to come a big step closer to our goal of 500,000 trees planted which will restore the magamba forest reserve and also will restore the livehood of the community of lushoto district through employment opportunities, food production and increase in agriculture activities around the small holder's farmers.IMPLEMENTATION:As part of our project, we will first convert seeds into seedlings. These seedlings are then imported into our nursery, with the community closely involved from the start - an important first step in realizing our plan. We will then plant trees in selected areas.

The global red panda population has declined by 50% over the last 20 years; estimates have them at less than 10,000 and as few as 2,500 remaining in the wild.Habitat loss is the primary threat to red pandas. Anthropogenic pressures from rapid human population growth and unsustainable living practices are causing the degradation and fragmentation of red panda habitat. As a tree- dwelling species, red pandas struggle to survive when forests are fragmented and populations become susceptible to genetic bottleneck. The common threats to the endangered species in the red panda habitat include free-grazing livestock, construction of rural roads through the core habitat, habitat fragmentation, habitat encroachment, human-wildlife conflict (mostly retaliatory killing), poaching and illegal wildlife trade, attack by free-roaming dogs, drying up of water sources, human disturbances during mating and breeding seasons of wildlife, lack of wildlife corridors, insufficient environmental awareness among local communities.To combat this crisis, RPN has adopted a comprehensive strategy to re-establish and link vital habitats.The \"Plant a Red Panda Home\" Campaign:In 2015, the Red Panda Network initiated habitat restoration initiatives with small-scale reforestation as a part of its community-based red panda conservation program. This initiative developed into a flagship campaign known as\u00e2\u0080\u009cPlant a Red Panda Home\u00e2\u0080\u009din 2020, which reforests core habitat and connects fragmented forest through land purchase and tree planting to create a wildlife corridor to sustain a viable red panda population. This will help in building a bio-bridge that connects the fragmented patches of red panda habitat not only in the habitat inside Nepal but also towards the protected areas of India.

This corridor connects protected areas in Nepal with Singalila National Park in India.The Restoration Process:We support local councils and community forest user groups to establish and run forest conservation nurseries located near restoration sites to reduce costs and enhance sapling survival rates. We also support local partner NGO to purchase seedlings for planting. The income from their local nurseries will help them to continue their nurseries in the long-run.

Whether a patch of land is cleared due to artificial causes (meaning, human activities such as slash-and-burn agriculture) or natural causes (such as a river changing its course), ecological succession sets in and pioneer trees start growing back right away.

The whole process of succession to return a bare patch of ground to something that possesses the diversity of a primary forest can take 200 years or more.Secondary forest enrichment planting is a way to speed up that process of succession, which in this case also means speeding up the introduction of species of trees that are useful for human needs, including endangered species. When trees are planted in a secondary forest, a broader range of biodiversity is introduced back into the landscape sooner. In practical terms, straight trails are created through the secondary forest and trees are planted all along those trails. Because of the shade provided by the pioneer trees' canopy, these enrichment strips only need to be weeded once or twice a year, a savings in work compared to planting trees on a bare plot, where weed growth can require monthly maintenance clearing.\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo date, we have planted over 5 hectares of secondary forest with enrichment strips of important species such as ungurahui (Oenocarpus bataua), which gives edible fruits, and mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), the Amazon's most valuable timber tree.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSuccessional agroforestryOne school of agroforestry, or \"farming with trees\", is called successional agroforestry.What this label basically implies is that when you design your agroforestry system, you take into consideration not only the physical dynamics of a forest's shape (how trees grow with each other compatibly in space) but also the importance of the factor of time.

Whether a patch of land is cleared due to artificial causes (meaning, human activities such as slash-and-burn agriculture) or natural causes (such as a river changing its course), ecological succession sets in and pioneer trees start growing back right away. Secondary forests are like the immune system of the landscape, quickly generating organic matter in the form of leaf litter to build soils in sites that are sometimes sterile sand (not soil) before the secondary forest gets to work. Secondary forests are quite different than old, pristine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cvirgin\u00e2\u0080\u009d primary forests. Only a few tree species predominate in the secondary forest for its first 50 years of growth, with the whole diverse range of tree species found in the primary forest being introduced little by little, by birds and other animals. \"Permanent\" or long-term, primary forest trees have to wait their turn in the shade to become established, finally getting to grow fully only when one of the pioneer trees falls and creates a light gap. The whole process of succession to return a bare patch of ground to something that possesses the diversity of a primary forest can take 200 years or more.Secondary forest enrichment planting is a way to speed up that process of succession, which in this case also means speeding up the introduction of species of trees that are useful for human needs, including endangered species.

When trees are planted in a secondary forest, a broader range of biodiversity is introduced back into the landscape sooner. In practical terms, straight trails are created through the secondary forest and trees are planted all along those trails. Because of the shade provided by the pioneer trees' canopy, these enrichment strips only need to be weeded once or twice a year, a savings in work compared to planting trees on a bare plot, where weed growth can require monthly maintenance clearing.\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo date, we have planted over 5 hectares of secondary forest with enrichment strips of important species such as ungurahui (Oenocarpus bataua), which gives edible fruits, and mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), the Amazon's most valuable timber tree.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSuccessional agroforestryOne school of agroforestry, or \"farming with trees\", is called successional agroforestry.What this label basically implies is that when you design your agroforestry system, you take into consideration not only the physical dynamics of a forest's shape (how trees grow with each other compatibly in space) but also the importance of the factor of time.

Trees like cacao (Theobroma cacao) and huasa\u00c3\u00ad (Euterpe precatoria) benefit from the forest-like conditions and do better when established in shade versus when established in a clear, open patch. As a result, we often plant trees in areas that already have some established trees, sometimes even 5- or 10-year-old trees as the canopy overhead. While many of the trees planted in the understory are relatively small (like cacao), others, like huasa\u00c3\u00ad, grow up into the canopy eventually and are structurally compatible with interplanting among other trees.

The Idiofa territory lost already 240.000 ha of forests in the last 50 years. The actual vegetation is a mixture of savannah highlands, with fragmentated gallery forests belong the rivers. Faja Lobi works to combat the resource degradation within the country brought on by population growth and overexploitation of soil and vegetation in the country. These programs, combining tree planting with cultural, educational, health, and economical programs contribute to the reconstruction of civil society and help local communities to protect the environment around them.Each restoration project starts by making an agreement with the population about the aim of forestry. An agreement is signed about the land use with financial compensation for the involved village and local workers are given a formation to start up nurseries & plant  forestry trees in the zones. Creation of fire breaks is an important issue in the formation. Tree planting restores landscape and is followed by a spontaneous regeneration of other species, which completes the biodiversity. Near the villages a zone for agroforestry is provided, so most of the forest can stay as natural zone.In pursuit of this goal, Faja Lobi only employs local people to achieve their goals: currently, around 500 local employees are working on their various reforestation projects. 80 percent of Faja Lobi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s budget contributes to the well-being of its workforce through salaries, meals,", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2035, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "468cc9e0-1df6-43b9-8141-3aa5a99b249e": {"__data__": {"id_": "468cc9e0-1df6-43b9-8141-3aa5a99b249e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "Reforestation and agroforestry in DR Congo", "url": "https://explorer.land/x/project/faja-lobi/", "contact": "{'user': 'Sarah Parent', 'envelope': 'sarah@goforest.be', 'phone': '+32 472 34 84 33', 'link': 'https://www.goforest.be/', 'earth-americas': 'Aatstraat 4, 9600 Ronse, Belgium'}", "location": "Region of Idiofa,Democratic Republic of the Congo", "document_title": "Empowering Local Communities Through Reforestation and Agroforestry: A Sustainable Approach to Environmental and Social Challenges in Congo-Kinshasa and Idiofa, Belgium", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

With the current population density increasing rapidly, the pressure on land is unsustainable. Human population is growing at an estimated 3.2% annually, and around 10% ofthe natural land is converted into agricultural land per annum. A 2017 census shows that approximately 3,187 households (or 20,200 people) currently live in Mukungule GMA, spread across 10 different village action groups (VAGs).A further key threat are the man-made (late) fires that inhibit regrowth and forest regeneration. These also have a severe effect on wildlife and wetlands (dambos) in terms of biodiversity, carbon storage and water retention capacity.A newer threat is unsustainable charcoal production, which is picking up especially in areas close to Mpika town.What will the project do?Under the scope of the USAID-funded (HEARTH) Global Development Alliance (GDA) led by Frankfurt Zoological Society (FZS), WeForest will scale up beekeeping as a conservation-compatible livelihood, thereby incentivizing local communities to restore degraded forest through beekeeping. It will also support associated sustainable forest management for a sustainable and long-lasting impact, with increases in direct and indirect benefits for the communities within the GMA through employment, training and better income through honey sales. The beekeeping model is to be developed based on market diagnosis.\n{'user': 'WeForest', 'envelope': 'sponsorship@weforest.org', 'link': 'https://www.weforest.org/'}", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1809, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c203a012-ecad-4f59-be39-0dfb9705ab01": {"__data__": {"id_": "c203a012-ecad-4f59-be39-0dfb9705ab01", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "REBORN DANUBE - STEP BY STEP", "url": "https://explorer.land/x/project/navrh/", "contact": "{'user': 'Michaela Kalivodova', 'envelope': 'kalivodova@broz.sk', 'phone': '00421917569979', 'link': 'https://broz.sk/en/'}", "location": "Danube basin,Slovakia", "document_title": "Restoring Biodiversity and Traditional Management along the Danube: A Comprehensive Approach", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

Forests where heroes and bandits hid and lived in exile, forests that they journeyed through perilously, forests where sages lived and gathered their disciples around them. Today these forests, once the wealth of a mighty land, are all but gone. From the foothills of the Himalayas to Cape Comorin less than 11% of India's land mass bears any form of tree cover. And despite a growing awareness of an ecological catastrophe in the making (20% of India's forest cover has disappeared since 1960), the destruction continues.History of the AreaAround two hundred years ago, also the Auroville plateau and its surrounding area was covered in forest. A stone was discovered in Kilianur dating from 1750 that described the local king hunting for elephants and tigers in the nearby forest. In 1825, trees were felled in the Jipmer area between Auroville and Pondy, to drive away the tigers.Slowly the forests were cut down to build cities like Pondicherry and towns like Kalapet. Timber was used for export, and the British accelerated the process by allocating plots of land to anyone who would clear it and cultivate it for a year. Much of it was then left fallow and under the violent onslaught of the monsoon, erosion inevitably began.The last remaining plots of forest in the Auroville area - 2,000 mature neem trees - were cut down in the mid-fifties for timber to make boats.

In less than 200 years, what once had been forest had turned into an expanse of baked red earth scarred with gullies and ravines which had been carved out by the monsoon floods. Each year tons of the remaining topsoil were swept into the nearby Bay of Bengal.Auroville's Early Trials and ErrorsThe first needs that confronted Auroville's earliest settlers were for shade and water. However, it soon became clear that if the young seedlings were to survive, other measures had to be taken. They needed to be protected, for example, against marauding goats and cows, and some way had to be found to catch and control the monsoon rains so that they would not sweep away precious topsoil but would percolate into the water table. So 'bunds' (raised earth-banks to stop water flowing off the land)were born. In these early years it was a process of trial and error, and many mistakes were made. For example, a massive dam erected near Forecomers broke in a heavy rain, because the water flow into the canyon was not controlled. Ten years later, in 1978, a freak rain of 30cms in 12 hours broke bunds and washed away numerous young trees. The lesson learned that time was that bunding had to be systematic and comprehensive, beginning on the top of the watershed and following the topography of the land. A large scale bunding system was eventually implemented starting from the tops of the watersheds and including not only Auroville owned plots but privately owned plots as well.

The first tree nurseries were started in Success and Kottakarai, and with the help of grants from the Point Foundation, the Tamil Fund and friends abroad, large-scale tree planting began. In the next ten years, as part of a massive soil and water conservation programme, over a million trees - timbers, ornamentals, fencing, fruit and fodder trees, nut trees etc.- were planted here. Some were exotic, like for instance the Australian 'Work Tree' (Mother's name for Acacia auriculiformis) which improved the quality of the soil, and provided the perfect pioneer canopy under which more advanced forest species could thrive. As the trees grew, and micro-climates formed, many species of bird-life and animals returned, further accelerating the dissemination of seeds and enriching the environment.The Pieces of the Puzzle Come TogetherIn the 1990's, teams of foresters and botanists surveyed the entire region around Auroville which receives similar rainfall patterns. They brought back seeds from Sacred Temple groves, where some of the last old growth trees of the original forests managed to survive. Auroville's nurseries began growing hundreds of different native species.

As a volunteer he began connecting with people through social media and local associations organising actions on reforestation and climate activism.

To encourage the local communities, educational material was developed incentivating individuals to self act, to improve their natural environment and to re-establishing the ecosystems with fauna and flora through reforestation. The Plantation designs are focus mainly in land recovering from forest fires,  using fire barrier and agroforesty principles.The project found lots of resistance, the  bureaucratic process of planting trees in public land was to complex and time restrictive.

Seeing the beauty of nature at risk they supported the lands directly pouring in time, energy, and resources for a decade before breaking even on the monthly costs to have boots on ground and in the mud.Eventually the forest conversation agency, INAB, of Guatemala's government launched a program, PROBOSQUE, to pay dividends to land projects that meet the stringent requirements set by international standards for wild land protection.

Undeniably, the main reason for deforestation in Madagascar is due to human activity. Therefore, B\u00c3\u00b4ndy made a concrete plan where we place the local populations at the heart of our projects. We are trying to create substitutes to the remaining primary forests in all regions of Madagascar by planting high valued species that will bring economical and environmental benefits for the local populations. All of our projects are driven by the desire to help Madagascar protect its most unique treasure and help local populations by giving them new alternatives and education related to environmental consciousness.The ProjectTamatave is an important economical region in Madagascar as we can find the biggest harbour of the country.

At B\u00c3\u00b4ndy, we believe that in order to reforest Madagascar effectively, we must analyze and address the causes of deforestation. Undeniably, the main reason for deforestation in Madagascar is due to human activity. Therefore, B\u00c3\u00b4ndy made a concrete plan where we place the local populations at the heart of our projects. We are trying to create substitutes to the remaining primary forests in all regions of Madagascar by planting high valued species that will bring economical and environmental benefits for the local populations. All of our projects are driven by the desire to help Madagascar protect its most unique treasure and help local populations by giving them new alternatives and education related to environmental consciousness.The ProjectThe district of Ambanja, located in the northwest of Madagascar, is a very fertile area that is sadly threatened by deforestation. The high rate of deforestation there is explained by the practice of slash and burn agriculture, the use of firewood and the production of charcoal in rural areas. To tackle this issue, it is therefore necessary to improve the living conditions of farmers.Cocoa production is an important activity in the region, with considerable economic potential. For this reason, the goal of this project is to work with the beneficiary farmers to establish cocoa plantations using the agroforestry model. Thus, cocoa trees will be cultivated with other high value tree species. Cocoa production under this model will allow degraded lands to regenerate and farmers to diversify and improve their sources of income.As part of this project, in addition to the economic aspect, several initiatives will be carried out at the social level to build the farmers ' capacities :-Raising awareness on environmental issues (deforestation and climate change);-Setting up a farmers' field school : to strengthen the technical capacities of farmers in cocoa cultivation, to enhance farmers' food security by training them in market gardening techniques and to strengthen their resilience to climate change;-Financial education: to train farmers to manage their financial resources.\n{'user': 'Gabriel Tasso',", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2261, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3234d15a-a269-4446-a690-19fa2f823bfb": {"__data__": {"id_": "3234d15a-a269-4446-a690-19fa2f823bfb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "Cocoa project in Ambanja, Madagascar", "url": "https://explorer.land/x/project/cocoa/", "contact": "{'user': 'Gabriel Tasso', 'envelope': 'gabriel.tasso@bondy.earth', 'phone': '+41798300336', 'link': 'https://www.bondy.earth/contact/'}", "location": "DIANA,Madagascar", "document_title": "\"Empowering Farmers in Ambanja through Sustainable Cocoa Agroforestry for Reforestation and Sustainable Development: Regenerating Lands, Diversifying Incomes, and Building Capacities\"", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

From being a great habitat for wildlife species, being great protection for coasts, and bringing an economical added value to the local population, it also is one of the greatest sources of carbon sequestration.The total area of mangrove forest in Madagascar covers about 20% of African mangroves and 2% of the world's mangroves. However, the mangrove forests of Bombetoka Bay have suffered a 34% loss between 1990 and 2000 (Report on the state of mangroves in Madagascar - WWF Madagascar) and this loss represents a major threat to biological biodiversity and the living conditions of local communities.Today, the mangrove can no longer play its economic and social role, which justifies the search for initiatives and alternatives for the revitalisation of this natural ecosystem. This revitalisation should respond to the concern for the preservation and ecological balance of this environment that is so vital for the local populations.

Our mission is to reverse poverty, climate change and biodiversity loss in an integrated manner through the restoration of degraded lands.How do we plan on achieving this?By converting degraded land into productive food forests that capture and store carbon;By training communities in Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR) techniques and in building forest enterprise cooperatives;By improving community incomes through wider market access, profit-sharing of carbon credit sales and trading of sustainably sourced food forest products.Outcomes so far165 hectares of degraded land are restored, and this number keeps rising.Roughly 1600 people (over 500 families) from the villages of the Solok and Agam districts already benefit from program. A total of 140 families participate in the rehabilitation work directly; each family manages around one hectare of land from which they get a decent livelihood. There is a waiting list of over 100 families eager to join the Food Forests Program. And lastly, our application to the Plan Vivo carbon certification scheme is currently being finalized.Assisted Natural Regeneration with the Food Forest ProgramIn West Sumatra, degraded village lands situated on the forest buffer zones are covered with Imperata grasslands, ferns and/or shrubby vegetation. They are not only unproductive but are also highly susceptible to wildfires which can spread rapidly to the surrounding forests. The grasses compete for survival with the seeds of indigenous tree species that are dispersed by wind, birds or other animals.To regenerate the land, local communities flatten the grass with a simple but very effective method \u00e2\u0080\u0093 by applying a lodging board or plank. This allows the small tree seedlings to grow easily as competition from the surrounding vegetation is reduced. As the Imperata grasses slowly decay, they add significant amounts of moisture and carbon to the soil.

The whole process of succession to return a bare patch of ground to something that possesses the diversity of a primary forest can take 200 years or more.Secondary forest enrichment planting is a way to speed up that process of succession, which in this case also means speeding up the introduction of species of trees that are useful for human needs, including endangered species. When trees are planted in a secondary forest, a broader range of biodiversity is introduced back into the landscape sooner. In practical terms, straight trails are created through the secondary forest and trees are planted all along those trails.

Different species appear in the system (or disappear from the system) at different times. For example, in many successional agroforestry systems, annual or short-lived perennials (such as maize and bananas) are planted in the system at the beginning, later harvested, and then disappear from the system. Trees are planted at the beginning of the system's establishment, but other trees (especially shade-loving ones) are planted into the system later in its lifespan.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn many of our agroforestry areas, we plant trees under the established canopy of trees that were planted back in the beginning of the system.

One significant aspect of their partnership involved the initiation of monitoring programs aimed at collecting data about marine species landings. This effort to empower local communities in managing their marine resources gained momentum when women from these villages embarked on exchange visits to Madagascar in 2017 and Zanzibar in 2018. These experiences inspired them to establish the first fisherwomen's association on the island, known as Maecha Bora. Notably, Maecha Bora played a pioneering role in implementing the first octopus fishery closure in Anjouan.Octopus fishing holds great importance on the island, providing a vital source of food and income, alongside other fisheries like pelagic fish such as tuna. The accessibility of octopus catch sites through methods like gleaning, which can be done on foot during low tide, makes it a preferred choice. Traditionally, men fish by boat, while women engage in foot-based octopus fishing.The octopus closures, initiated in 2018 and followed by two more in 2020, proved highly successful. In February 2021, after a 3-month closure, the average weight of octopuses caught doubled compared to those caught before the closure or outside the closed fishing areas. To enhance the effectiveness of these closures, local associations in Anjouan joined forces, implementing additional fisheries management measures, including the mandatory use of the mwiri (wooden stick) instead of the ntsontso (metal rod) during reopening days. They also prohibited the capture of juvenile octopuses weighing less than 500 grams to allow them to reach reproductive age before being caught.These data collection initiatives are essential for community management measures and decision-making, as the communities heavily depend on reef harvesting for food security.

Leaving Holland behind where he was raised in a biodynamic farm with parents with a vision to collaborate with nature. Arriving in Vinha Velha, he recognized a similar pioneering spirit as was present . This farm and the Algarvian landscape were calling him to serve his life mission of regenerating ecosystems and empowering people to reconnect with holistic regenerative practices. Together with a team of likeminded people they started making their ideals more concrete in the form of the Restore Nature Foundation.2: Vinha VelhaHuber, founder of Vinha Velha bought this 140hectare piece of land 40 years ago together with his brother Michael. He had a big vision to run a self sufficient and organic farm with a lot of tree, plant and animals diversity. Back then, the 140 acres of land were infertile and there was no electricity or running water; everything had to be built up from scratch. First, the land was systematically reforested in order to stop erosion, while creating lakes to save the winter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rainfall for the dry summer months. The water supply provided the farm with a source of life: vegetable gardens and animals were introduced to lay down the basic fundamentals of the farm.Years of hard work and cooperation resulted in built up organic agriculture with vegetable gardens, fruit trees, cows, chickens, sheep, donkeys and bees. Products are sold in the little shop on the farm and in local organic markets and shops. Thousands of trees have been planted over the years to stop erosion and to rebuild ecosystems. 5 lakes provide a sustainable source of water for the", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2168, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d150bcb-2ca0-4e7f-b6de-08fd527e7942": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d150bcb-2ca0-4e7f-b6de-08fd527e7942", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "Restore Nature in Southern Portugal", "url": "https://explorer.land/x/project/vinhavelha_restornature/", "contact": "{'user': 'Matthijs Wansink', 'envelope': 'matthijswansink@gmail.com', 'phone': '+31634546373'}", "location": "Algarve,Portugal", "document_title": "Restoring Balance and Empowering Communities: The Story of Restore Nature Foundation and Vinha Velha in the Algarve", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

The recent bushfire that started on June 20th 2020 kept the area in its grip for several days and made quite an impact in the landscape. Many areas were burned; many people lost their houses and the landscape was left severely damaged. The fire reached the neighbouring land of Vinha Velha but because of the enormous efforts of firemen from the air and on the ground, the fire did not harm Vinha Velha.These raging fires are an alarming signal that nature is out of balance.

While Ghana's Constitution vests ownership of the land in the Stool or Skin (the traditional or customary leadership structures that preside over a particular ethnic group, clan or tribe and the associated land and resources) it gives the Government the right to manage the naturally occurring resources for economic gain.

The CREMA represents a profound policy shift by permitting communities, landowners and land users an opportunity to govern and manage forest and wildlife resources within the boundaries of the CREMA, and to benefit financially or in kind. The CREMA process has followed a nearly 20 year evolution in Ghana from an intellectual concept to an approved pilot initiative and finally to an authorized mechanism, which is now seeking full legal backing from Parliament.The Congruence of InterestsThe CREMA concept directly reflects the principles of Firey's biosocial theory, providing communities formal access and user-rights to the forest resources (ecologically possible), it is built upon traditional values and cultural systems (culturally adoptable), and it aims at generating financial and non-financial resources for communities and individuals within the CREMA (economically gainful). Depending on the scenario, the CREMA either supports and expands the scope of land-use practices and management decisions that already contain elements of sustainability (wildlife conservation through taboos and traditional hunting norms), or in an unsustainable situation (deforestation) it can entirely change the biophysical, economic and social conditions and resources that affect decision-making at the individual, community and social landscape level, opening up the possibility for different resource-use decisions and more sustainable outcomes.The need for building", "start_char_idx": 2831, "end_char_idx": 5235, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2209f3d-7c87-4048-9489-0b5b25b7a3b5": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2209f3d-7c87-4048-9489-0b5b25b7a3b5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"EGS Provider": "Kogyae Strict Nature Reserve", "url": "https://explorer.land/x/project/kogyae/", "contact": "{'user': 'Kofi Debrah', 'envelope': 'kofi@okoforests.com', 'phone': '233544059968', 'link': 'http://www.okoforests.com/'}", "location": "Ashanti Region,Ghana", "document_title": "Sustainable Forest Management and Community Engagement for Biodiversity Conservation and Economic Development in Ghana: A Focus on Reforestation, Agroforestry, and the CREMA Mechanism", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

In this landscape, Eden works with government and community stakeholders to design and implement complementary conservation, restoration, and agroforestry programs. These programs are changing the trajectory of this degraded protected area and aim to ensure the healthy future of Mecuburi and the communities it supports.Located in Nampula Province, Mecuburi Forest Reserve is Mozambique's largest miombo woodland forest reserve. Miombo woodland is a tropical dry forest type that represents 10% of Africa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s land cover. Expansion of agriculture threatens forest quality, extent, and connectivity of miombo landscapes across the continent. This degradation jeopardizes the biodiversity of miombo habitats, which host an estimated 8,500 species of plants, over half of which are endemic to this biome. Mecuburi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current state of degradation is representative of this broader challenge.Mecuburi Forest Reserve was established in 1950 to protect the watershed of the Mecuburi River and provide resources to the region. The Mecuburi River watershed is one of few entirely contained within Mozambique\u00e2\u0080\u0099s borders. This means that its health and protection are not dependent on neighboring countries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 policies or deforestation trends, but on the actions taken to conserve and restore the watershed within a single jurisdiction.  In Mozambique, water has been identified as a key constraint to economic development and poverty reduction. The Mecuburi River is a current and potential water source for upwards of 1 million people, making it a key restoration priority in the broader Nampula provincial landscape.Additionally, the forest provides a variety of natural, freely available food sources, such as edible mushrooms, which are a staple in the local food supply. Natural food sources are core to climate resilience for rural communities that rely on rain-fed agriculture for subsistence.

This project is ready to receive funding to support more comprehensive engagement, detailed restoration planning, and the development of supporting initiatives that will sustain the restoration into the future.Investment needed:We are seeking an initial investment to fund project development, the early stages of preparation and implementation, and the design of supporting initiatives to address drivers of deforestation and create sustainable livelihood opportunities within this landscape.Returns on investment:The primary returns on this investment are social and environmental, including:A comprehensive, collaboratively developed restoration plan for the largest forest reserve in Mozambique.Establishing a new precedent for forest reserve management in areas that have been heavily encroached on in recent decades in Mozambique. Mozambique is home to 13 forest reserves, the vast majority of which are degraded.Millions of indigenous trees produced and monitored over the life of the projectIncreased forest connectivity within the landscapeLivelihood opportunities for communities in and adjacent to the Reserve, both through direct employment, seed collection, agroforestry programs, and complementary initiatives defined in later phases of project developmentSecuring the future of the Mecuburi River, which supplies water to communities within and adjacent to the ReserveProtection of rapidly disappearing forests in Nampula province. Forests protected in this project are core to successful restoration because they contribute to the genetic diversity of the seed that supports restoration goals.About Eden Reforestation Projects in Mozambique:Eden operates over 60 reforestation sites in Mozambique, including mangrove and miombo forest types.

The reforestation programme is regenerating previously forested areas through sensitive large-scale mixed-species tree planting (including fir, beech, spruce, rowan and sycamore), in areas adjacent to and buffering existing natural forests. These are areas that have been brutally clear-cut, located at high altitudes closed to alpine areas and where natural regeneration has not occurred. In these kinds of areas, intervention helps to bring nature back much faster, enabling the restoration of complex ecosystems.The plantationsThe plantations will become part of the largest protected national park in Europe and be included in a Natura 2000 Zone (protected by European Law) through local partners. They will evolve into closed forests (over the first ten years), during which time the trees will be monitored and maintained (for example some limited cutting of grass around saplings until they become established, and cutting back invasive plant species to stop them from taking over in areas where they are not natural), but after the first years, there will be no more human interventions as regeneration will happen all by itself.

Overall emission are around 9 million CO2/year. Climate change and forest loss lead to high rates of water loss and droughts, while rural livelihoods highly depend on local water sources. Agriculture becomes harder to survive from in a context of climate change. West Timor has only one rainy season of about 3 months, but the result of climate change is that rainy seasons can no longer be predicted in duration and occurence. Deforestation causes erosion and has reduced the water holding capacity. Rivers run dry quickly, which puts livelihoods further at risk, as drinking water and water for agricultural purposes become increasingly difficult to sustain. There is widespread unemployment with income levels at about one-third the national average.  Young people in particular tend to leave the area. Reforestation combined with wateruse-efficient solutions for agriculture can increase water availability over a longer period. If planned well, it could also provide better employment opportunties. West Timor has always been know for its beautiful fabrics made from local unirrigated cotton, coloured with  natural dyes from indigenous shrubs and trees which (used to ) grow in surrounding degrading forests. Weaving has  always been a major economic activity for the rural people,  women in particular.As young people tend to leave, the weaving techniques and activities also will decline. However, there is a good opportunity to improve the weaving techniques and develop hip, fashionable \"indigenous\" patterns for which demand is growing in Indonesia and the global market.In this project, we aim to combine forest rehabilitation with the training of women in making fashionable fabrics that can be used in the fashion industry of the growing  Indonesian market in the cities (and abroad).

Our goal is to create self sustainable and economically attractive restoration projects in order to create an economic alternative to cattle and traditional farming.The Buffer Zone of the Maya Biosphere Reserve has around 500k Ha and has suffered degradation on 75% of its territory. There is a very good opportunity to create a restoration project at a landscape level. All land is private and can be bought and sold in this area which helps to create a safe investment environment.Green Balam Forests goal is to buy available properties and create reforestation, carbon, agroforestry, ecotourism and conservation projects in order to create biological corridors which will help to restore and protect biodiversity. While creating this projects, Green Balam Forests will provide local communities with high quality and lasting job opportunities, training, environmental education, better and healthier nutrition and business opportunities.Now, Green Balam Forests has 5 projects in different areas in the Multiple Use and Buffer Zones. This projects where selected by acquiring available land which was otherwise been deforested to be used as cattle pastures. Together, the 5 projects sum around 1,000 Ha in 2 years.

These projects respond to different emergencies: act against global warming, preserve biodiversity, the quality of water and soil, contribute to the well-being of farm animals or even generate resources for local supply.Founded by the young trio, Lucas Gossiaux, Aricia Evlard and Romain Riberaud, bioengineer, biologist, and geographer specializing in territorial development, PlantC offers a unique solution allowing companies and committed citizens to contribute to these plantation projects with multiple impacts, in Belgium. PlantC, therefore, works upstream with farmers and foresters in the organization of their planting project.PlantC's reason for being is to promote the symbiosis between Man and the Living as local transition solutions. PlantC's action is not just about \"planting trees\". The ambition is stronger by developing productive symbioses between Human and his environment.

The temperature increase and the reduction of frost periods amplified to the multiplication of pests.The forest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decline generates discouragement among most foresters, witnessing that the work done over several generations has been reduced to nothing. In this context, and given the uncertainty induced by climate change, many landowners are giving up investing in reforestation of their areas. However, forests offer many important ecosystem services: carbon storage, habitats for biodiversity, water and air quality, well-being and wood production.Therefore, the Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 Royale Foresti\u00c3\u00a8re de Belgique (SRFB) and Sylva Nova are joining forces with PlantC and Go Forest to support reforestation in Belgium.

Throughout southern Africa, the threats driving vulture population declines are complex and dynamic, varying from one region to the next. Although habitat loss, persecution, and electrocutions on power lines are major threats, the decline of African vultures is largely due to direct and indirect poisoning. To address the highly dynamic threat landscape across southern Africa, the Endangered Wildlife Trusts (EWT) Birds of Prey Programme has spearheaded the establishment of Vulture Safe Zones (VSZs). A VSZ is a geographic area where we use targeted conservation measures to address the key threats to the relevant vulture species. We work directly with landowners and communities in these safe zones to reduce the impacts of threats such as poisoning and collisions or electrocutions with energy infrastructure. We engage with owners of large land portions and empower them to manage their properties in wildlife-friendly ways.  In 2020, the EWT launched a series of VSZ projects across strategic sites in southern Africa. To date we have secured commitment from over 450 landowners and communities to becoming VSZs, comprising an area of over 2 million hectares, where we are working tirelessly to improve awareness and remove key threats to vultures, benefiting a host of other wildlife.Even in VSZs, poisoning is the biggest threat to vultures. Illegal trade has seen thousands of vultures poisoned across Africa, devastating populations, and driving them rapidly towards extinction in the wild. Scavenging mammals including Lions, Hyaenas and Leopards are also severely impacted by poisoning. A key factor limiting the capacity to reduce or avoid the largescale loss of wildlife to poisoning, is our ability to locate and respond quickly to poisoning events.

Every bird counts.To address this ominous threat in southern and east Africa, the EWT and its partners, has harnessed the natural sentinel and foraging behaviour of vultures to our advantage and coupled this with novel GPS-tracking technology; developing a pioneering rapid poisoning detection system, which we have called Eye in the Sky. Using GPS-tracked vultures, we have developed an effective monitoring system using both built-in GPS device activity sensors and post-hoc algorithms, that is able to rapidly alert us to vulture mortality, within an hour of death. This has important implications for triggering mortalities due to poisoning in poisoning hotspot areas, allowing the early detection of wildlife poisoning events. The early detection of a poisoned carcass or bait source, and the immediate decontamination of a poisoning scene, drastically reduces the further, unnecessary loss of wildlife. This system closely monitors the behavioral signatures, immobility and spatial clustering in GPS-tracked vultures in near real time, to remotely detect the presence of poison sources and feeding events associated with potentially poisoned-laced carcasses.

It is projected to encompass the largest community led mass-planting event in the Greater Cape Floristic Region. While planting has been happening for ten years, the scope and rigour of this restoration plan takes the process to a new level.The plan began in 2018 with mapping the site to assess the condition of the vegetation on site. Once this was completed, work was done to identify target sites for restoration; prepare the ground through alien and litter clearance; collect seeds on site and in neighbouring similar habitats; cultivate and plant these.Biodiversity at Princess Vlei has been impacted by several human encounters.

In the 1940\u00e2\u0080\u0099s canals were constructed to channel storm water and manage the seasonal water level fluctuation. The vlei was dredged to stop flooding when Prince George Drive was widened.More recently the area has been used for recreational activities such as angling, braaing, dog walking, and sports. Severe neglect by the authorities over several decades led to these activities taking a heavy toll on the vegetation on site. Although the management has improved, some littering, sand mining and dumping continues to impact some areas.However, remnants of the endemic Cape Flats Dune Strandveld (CFDS) and the critically endangered Cape Flats Sand Fynbos (CFSF) remain within the Greater Princess Vlei Conservation Area (GPVCA). Six sand fynbos plant species are recorded as extinct, and around 100 more species of Conservation Concern survive in several, mostly degraded, urban remnants.

Six sand fynbos plant species are recorded as extinct, and around 100 more species of Conservation Concern survive in several, mostly degraded, urban remnants. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critical that all efforts be made to restore these species as far as possible.Over the next three years, we are planning to restore 5 to 10 hectares of three endangered habitat types. This will include reintroducing 17 threatened species to the conservation area, including Erica verticillata and Serruria foeniculacea. Both grew widely in the area in the past (Erica Verticillata gave Heathfield its name) but are now extinct in the wild. An intensive monitoring programme will track the success of the rehabilitation. The conservation returns will contribute towards multiple targets of the National Plant Conservation Strategy.School learners and community members will be involved in every step of the process. The seeds and seedlings are planted by large groups from the community, and local schools. Follow up work is done with school learners to assess the survival rate of the plants, check pollinator and other faunal activity. Environmental Education workshops will be held to introduce communities to nature and conservation. Creative arts will be used to build awareness of the project, and to build appreciation of biodiversity. Researchers and tertiary institutions are invited to participate in and study the project.\u00e2\u0080\u008bWe plan to use this restoration project as a modular and scalable model for community led active conservation project in an urban setting. The enriched condition of the habitat will allow for more diverse community interactions between fauna and flora of all kinds and define conservation and Princess Vlei for decades to come. But the project will also grow a network of community conservationists, with a passion for nature and the skills to protect and nurture it.\n{'user': 'Denisha Anand', 'envelope':
